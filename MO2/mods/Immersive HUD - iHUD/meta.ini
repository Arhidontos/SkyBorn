nexusDescription="[color=cyan]What is iHUD?[/color]\r<br />The aim of iHUD is to provide the immersive feel you get from having no HUD, whilst keeping the usefulness of having one. It takes the permanantly visible HUD elements such as compass and crosshair, and hides them when not needed. Hence the motto:\r<br />\r<br />HUD when you need. HIDE when you don&#39;t.\r<br />\r<br />[color=#ff0000]Important[/color]\r<br />This mod is a beta test and will require SKSE64 that is currently in alpha test phase. Please understand that by testing SKSE64 at this stage you are using a tool that is currently unsupported by the devs and may have bugs/issues that could affect your game and even your save. But absolutely sure you are willing to take the risk before using SKSE64.\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]qyoAQfei79w[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />[color=cyan]Important[/color]\r<br />This mod requires SKSE64.\r<br />\r<br />Get updates on my mods/videos on my\xa0[url=http://twitter.com/GopherGaming]twitter channel[/url].\r<br />\r<br />[color=cyan]What does it let you do?[/color]\r<br />1. Toggle the compass with the &#39;x&#39; key. You can change this through the MCM settings or by going to console and typing &#39;set iHUDKey to X&#39; where X is the numerical scancode for the key.\r<br />2. The crosshair is only visible when using a ranged weapon/staff or a spell, or when hovering over an activatable item.\r<br />3. Allows you to change the transparancy of the compass and crosshair seperately (see video).\r<br />4. Floating quest markers only visible when the compass is visible (see video).\r<br />5. Allow you to remove the sneak meter, but keep the crosshair when using bow, staff or spell (see video).\r<br />6. Speeds up how fast the magicka, health and stamina bars disappear once you regain 100%.\r<br />\r<br />[color=cyan]Installation[/color]\r<br />1.
