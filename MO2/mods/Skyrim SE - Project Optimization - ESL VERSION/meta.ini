nexusDescription="[left]   [img]https://i.imgur.com/HdtDTRR.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[size=3][i]\n<br />[/i][/size][size=2]This is a performance boosting mod originally released for Oldrim. Seeing that this fantastic mod had not been ported to SSE, I decided to port it myself. Below is a description of the mod taken from the Oldrim Page. I have received permission from RGabriel15 to port this mod.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=3][/size][size=3][/size][quote][size=3]\xfeff[/size][size=3]\xfeffThis mod started as an attempt\xa0to improve the performance losses in some interiors when using Realistic Lighting Overhaul, up to version 4.0.6. Initially it was called Occlusion Culling Performance Patch (OCPP) on RLO page, but then I decided to expand things.\n<br />I started this new project with the goal to improve the performance in every interior as possible for everybody.\n<br />\n<br />If you use highly demanding mods as Realistic Lighting Overhaul (RLO), Enhanced Lights and FX (ELFX) or ENB's then this mod is for you as it will give you some fps boost depending on your hardware. Even if you are not using any demanding mod or just playing the vanilla game, this mod will improve your performance.\n<br />\n<br />In other words... this mod is a MUST if you want better performance in interiors for FREE!\n<br />\n<br />Yeah, this mod don't remove anything from the game neither will make your graphics looks worse. You will play the game the way it is, but with more performance!\n<br />[/size][/quote][size=3]\n<br />The mod consists of the following modules:\n<br />[MAIN MODULE]\xa0Skyrim Project Optimization - Full Version: The main module containing both Skyrim and the DLC's[/size]\n<br />[size=3][b]SINCE THIS IS FOR SSE, IT IS ASSUMED THAT YOU\xa0HAVE\xa0[/b][b]ALL THE DLCs\n<br />\n<br />[/b][b]FOR A LIST OF INTERIORS OPTIMIZED BY THIS MOD, THIS IMAGE LISTS THEM ALL:\xa0[/b][url=https://i.postimg.cc/1yPy4sQc/Edited-Locations.jpg]https://i.postimg.cc/1yPy4sQc/Edited-Locations.jpg[/url][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/GKE46Y9.png[/img]\xfeff[/size]\n<br />[size=3]   \xfeffI used a feature called[b]\xa0[/b][url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_surface_determination]Occlusion Culling[/url], where I manually put occlusion planes in some spots of the interiors to improve performance.\n<br />What these occlusion planes do is un-render parts of the cell/objects/NPC's that are not being seen by the player, in most cases behind a wall or above/below floors (occluded).\xa0\n<br />\n<br />Why make your hardware render things when they are not being seen, right?! \n<br />\n<br />Occlusion Culling is an old technique used in lots of games including Skyrim, so don't worry about any damage to your hardware because what it does is the opposite:\n<br />\n<br />If less things are being drawn on-screen at the same time, it means your hardware is using less processing power to achieve the same thing, and it automatically converts into better performance.\n<br />\n<br />\xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/Nc6mtyL.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff[youtube]eBIIRia9o60[/youtube][/size]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/MlaEGsV.png[/img]\n<br />[size=3]This mod is compatible with any mod out there, providing they don't add occlusion planes/cubes on the same interiors of my mod. \n<br />\n<br />Essentially, the occlusion culling planes this mod adds are hidden within the walls of buildings. So all you need to do to ensure compatibility is to make sure you don't have any mods installed that alters the actual architecture of the buildings.\xa0\n<br />\n<br />The mod has also been edited to fully support USSEP.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][img]https://i.imgur.com/irv3Pkl.png[/img]\xfeff[/b]\n<br />[size=3][i]As my mod adds objects (occlusion planes) to Cells, it could revert other mods changes (like lighting, fog, etc) back to vanilla. Aware of that, I made the plugin as a master (.esm). All you need to do is load my mod immediately after the game and DLC's .esm files and before any mod .esm or .esp. That way you will ensure other mods overwrite my mod and have no conflicts.\xa0[/i]\n<br />[/size][size=3][u]\n<br />CORRECT LOAD ORDER:\n<br />[/u]\n<br />[b]A correct load order with my mod being loaded after main .esm AND USSEP.esp files but before Climates of Tamriel.esm and other mods.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim.esm\n<br />Update.esm\n<br />Dawnguard.esm\n<br />Hearthfire.esm\n<br />Dragonborn.esm\n<br />Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp\xa0[b](it's actually\xa0\x61n .esm)\xa0[/b]\n<br />Skyrim Project Optimization.esm\n<br />Climates of Tamriel.esm\n<br />[IF YOU USE THE .esp VERSION, THE MOD SHOULD GO HERE]\n<br />other .esp plugins\n<br />\n<br />[u]INCORRECT LOAD ORDER:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b]An incorrect load order with my mod being loaded after main .esm [i]and[/i] after Climates of Tamriel.esm.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim.esm\n<br />Update.esm\n<br />Dawnguard.esm\n<br />Hearthfire.esm\n<br />Dragonborn.esm\n<br />Climates of Tamriel.esm\n<br />Skyrim Project Optimization.esm\n<br />Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp\n<br />other .esp plugins\n<br />\n<br />[/size][b][u][size=5]   \xfeff   \xfeff   \xfeff[img]https://i.imgur.com/poNKAPV.png[/img]\xfeff\n<br />[/size][/u][/b][size=3]\n<br />[b]USSEP (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) :[/b]\xa0[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/\xa0[/url]\xfeff\xfeff\xfeff[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u][b]CREDITS:[/b][/u]\n<br />[/size][size=3]Bethesda (For making the game)\n<br />RGabriel15 (For making this wonderful mod)[/size][/left]"
