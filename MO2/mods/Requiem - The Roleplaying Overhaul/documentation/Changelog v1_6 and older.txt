Changes in 1.6
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Perk-related Changes:

- The Perk Basic Blacksmithing has been renamed to "Craftmanship" and now also requires a book to be acquired. 

- The Book needed is called "The Craftman's Manual", and is avaialable in almost every blacksmith's shop and can be found in the world randomly.

- The Perk Craftmanship now is a prequisite to create Leather and Leather Strips at a Tanning Rack

- The Perk "Precise Aim" no only drains 5 points of Stamina each second when zooming in

- The Perk "Self Sufficient" has been removed - Instead, you can now create your own lockpicks at a smelter if you have both the Craftmanship perk and the Basic Lockpicking perk

- The Perk "Agility (Rank I)" has been merged with the Perk "Fleet Feet"

- The Perk "Fleet Feet" has been renamed to "Agile Spellcasting", which almost negates any penalties for casting spells in Light Armor. It is no longer a Prequisite for the Perk "Vexing Flanker".

- The Perk "Alchemical Lore" is now required to be able to make potions (with a magnitude/duration greater than 0) - This does not apply to races that get an Alchemy Advantage

- The Perk "Enchanter's Insight" is now required to be able to make enchantments (with a magnitude/duration greater than 0) - This does not apply to races that get an Enchantment Advantage

- The Perk "Strong Fists" has been renamed to "Martial Arts" and should now work as intended. Also, it is now required to be able to perform unarmed finishing moves (however, these do no longer work on heavily armored targets - so you'll no longer be throwing around a guy in full plate armor as if he was a sack of feathers)

- The Perk "Haggling" now grants a higher bonus on received gold when selling things

- The Perk "Merchant" now grants an additional bonus on selling your items

- The Perk "Fighting Stance" has been renamed to "Swift Strikes". It now also is required to perform kill moves with one-handed weapons, including dual-wielded attacks.

- The Perk "Balanced Stance" has been renamed to "Barbaric Might". It now also is required to perform kill moves with two-handed weapons. (It should no longer be possible to chop off an enemie's head with a pure blunt weapon)

- The Perk "Elven Blacksmithing" is now required additionally to be able to craft more exotic weapons like Katanas, Wakizashis or Scimitars of any type.

- The Perk "Enchantment Mastery" now decreases all charge costs by 15%, allows to place two enchantments on a single item with only 55% efficiency and still allows to create daedric staves.

- The Perk "Soul Gem Mastery" is now a part of the main enchanting tree

- The Perk "Arcane Maelstrom" has been removed

- The Perk "Perfected Art" now allows you to pickpocket things even if the victim can currently see you

- The Perk "Juggernaught" no longer grants an attack damage bonus, but decreases the attack speed and movement speed penalties for wearing heavy armor

- The Perk "Alchemical Lore" (Rank II) no longer allows to craft Poisonous Oils (which have been removed entirely). Instead, it allows you to create special dusts at a smelter with the same components. For technical reasons, these powders are classified as scrolls. They can be used as close-ranged weapons, and fully work on anything, even things immune to poisons (if not explicitly said otherwise). Every 25 points of your alchemy skill, a new type can be made: 0 -> Frost Powder, 25 -> Fire Powder, 50 -> Void Powder ; we plan to further expand this concept with time!

- The Perk "Regenration (Rank I)" has been merged with its second rank

- The Perk "Herbalism has been removed

- The Perk "Concentrated Poisons" has been changed: Instead of a fixed amount of additional charges, it now grants additional charges based on your alchemy skill level. It also has been swapped in position with the "Improved Poisons" perk

- The Perk "Self-Experimentation" has been merged with the second rank of Alchemical Lore


- The Perk Trees of "Onehanded" and "Twohanded" have been altered a bit in appearance by rearraning perk requirements for weapon specialization perks


- The Perk "Draconic Rhetoric" has been renamed to "Lore of the Thu'um" and is now independant of other speechcraft perks. It becomes unlocked after you have completed your first training with the Greybeards.

- The Perk "Tongue's Insight" has been added, and is obtainable as soon as you have completed your first training with the Greybeards. It allows you to trade a perk point for a dragon's soul, as it reflects the Dovahkiin meditating on his unused potential and thus, to instinctively harness a word of power. It can be taken an unlimited amount of times.

- The Perk "The Way of the Voice" has been added, and is obtainable as soon as you have met Parthurnaax for the first time. It grants you the power "Tongue's Trance". If you already have the power because you're a Nord, it's duration is doubled instead.

- The Perk "Destructive Urge" has been added, and is obtainable as soon as you have talked to Parthurnaax and meditated on the Word "Yol". The perk then grants you 15% additional power with all shouts for as long as you keep meditating on "Yol".

- The Perk "Spiritual Equilibrium" has been added, and is obtainable as soon as you have talked to Parthurnaax and meditated on the Word "Feim". The perk then grants you 15% longer durations with all shouts for as long as you keep meditating on "Feim".

- The Perk "Indomitable Force" has been added, and is obtainable as soon as you have talked to Parthurnaax and meditated on the Word "Fus". The perk then decreases the duration and power of all shouts directed at you by 50% for as long as you keep meditating on "Fus".


- Perks that grant an attack speed bonus have been decreased in effect slightly

- Perks that grant Dual Cast abilities have been renamed and fleshed out a bit


- Certain Light Armor perks now grant a variable bonus depending on how many pieces of Heavy Armor you wear - the less, the better the effect. No heavy armor at all means you get the full effect, a full set of Heavy Armor means you get no benefit at all. All perks that do not state anymore that they require NO worn Heavy Armor in order to work are affected.

Items added:

- Tyranus now wears a very impressive Plate Armor. You can also craft it with the Legendary Blacksmithing perk. Many thanks to dopalacz (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/3478029) for allowing us to use resources for that from his mod SPOA Silver Knight Armor (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32275)! :)

NPC-related changes:

- The Enchanted Sphere's regeneration can now be surpressed with Lightning Spells

- Some Horses now come with a Horse Armor - While it cannot be removed or customized, it grants it additional armor. However, these horses also pay for it with a reduced Stamina, carry weight and speed. But since they are trained to wear armor ,they also are sturdier and thus also receive extra Health points.

- Decreased the accuracy of marksman very slightly

- Decreased the armor rating of small Frostbite Spiders

- Handplaced a bunch of NPCs in Blackreach

- Increased the speed of very small Frostbite Spiders by about 35%

- The Vigilants of Stendarr and members of the Silver Hand have been tweaked a lot - see for yourself! ;)

- Killing Madanach should no longer count as murder

- Killing the Couriers in the related Civil War Quests should no longer count as murder

- Ugor now can only be killed by the player character

- Bandit Wizards now are less terrifying than those fully edjucated mages. They will most often have no Lightning spells that hit you instantly, and they also will appear less frequently. When you had a 100% chance to meet a Bandit wizard, it's now about 33% in most cases. In their place, other bandits may spawn instead.

- NPC Wizards now should use a wider variety of robes

- Horse Saddlebags no longer are accessed by (dis)mounting it with nothing equipped in your hands. Instead, the player character now receives a new ability called "Search". If you use it while targeting a saddled horse or a reanimated undead (they need to be in melee range!), their inventory will be opened. It does not work on hostile targets, though! It should also work on every saddled horses, even on those from other mods or those added by no yet supported DLCs!

- The new "Search" ability also enables you to rob most fleeing NPCs of some of their valuables. Not equipped armor, but most other things, so you can actually loot a bit and still choose to let yielding NPCs live. Unfortunately, it might not work as intended all the way, but mostly! ;)

- A few encounters have been handplaced in various parts of Skyrim

- Most Dwarven Automatons now receive additional damage from maces and warhammers

- Highelves now receive 40% additional damage from all magical sources instead of just 25%

- Bretons now receive 20% magical resistance instead of 15% and their racial power now features a 100% absorb chance for 8 seconds instead of 50% for 30.

- NPCs should now block and attack slightly more often

- Mercer Frey should now be significantly stronger

- Enthir in the College of Winterhold now has a single Bag of Holding for sale

- Halved the damage of most Invisible Entities

- Increased the power of Dragonpriests (50 points of health regained every second, 500 points more max health, 100 points of additional armor)

- Large Spiders, Sabrecats, Bears, and Mammoths can now knock things down with most of their power attacks if the attack is not blocked

- Alduin received a few additional abilities and tweaks

- Horse trampling has been improved: Now, only things in a small cone in front of the sprinting horse will be affected. This will make it much harder to hit things with the trample effect, especially in narrow terrain. However, it will also make it much more controllable and should prevent (most of) the tedious situations that can happen currently! Not sure if this change will work on existing savegames without further tweaking, though!

- Some Animals now have a somewhat higher chance to infect you with diseases

- Vampires no longer regenerate health by default

- Vampires no longer benefit from most Health Restoring potions and enchantments

- Vampires are now capable of infecting the player with vampirism with their normal attacks instead of just their drain life spell, jsut as in previous titles

- If the player is a vampire, these tweaks will now be effective (in general, the blood mechanism has been reverted - the more hungry you are, the weaker you become):

� The Power "Vampire's Seduction" is available from stages 2 to 4, being a side-effect of an increasing thirst for blood.
� The Power "Embrace of Shadows" has been renamed to "Vampiric Hunger" - it still is only available in the last Stage of Vampirism, as a final resort of the blood-crazed character to find a source of blood. It now only works when it's night.
� The Power "Nightstalker's Footsteps" and "Champion of the Night" now only works in the first stage of Vampirism
� The Power "Vampire's Sight" will no longer work if your in the fourth Stage of Vampirism
� The Power and Duration of the power Vampire's Servant now is reverted - the higher the Stage of Vampirism, the weaker it gets
� The Power of the Life Drain power now decreases with the Stage of Vampirism
� The Frost resistance granted by Vampirism has been increased and reverted - the higher the stage of vampirism, the lesser its protection
� The Overall Health Bonuses tied to the Stage of your vampirism have been decreased
� The secondary Health Bonuses tied to the Stage of your vampirism have been reverted: The higher it is, the less health and unarmed bonus damage you receive
� The Weakness to Fire has been greatly increased, and increases further with every Stage above one

� Vampires will no longer gain any benefits (and disadvantages) from consuming any worldly food
� Vampires now start on Stage 4, not 1. Make sure to feast as soon as possible, or perish!
� Vampires now are healed by 100 points of health when feeding on a target
� Vampires now are not send to Stage 1 when feeding, but only one stage higher than they before feeding. So if you are on stage 4, and feed, you will not end up on 1, but on 3. When on 3, on 2. And so on.

� The screen visuals you get when entering the outside world while it's day will now stick to you until you find shelter from the sun's searing light!

� Feeding on a target will decrease its maximum health by about the same amount the vampire is healed by. If the victim has not enough Health, it will die while feeding. Also, if the target survives, it will not have enough blood left for you to just suck out of it, thus rendering it yielding no more blood for the next three days. And be very careful about who you feed from, even some important characters can die from drinking them dry...

� Being in a place that is strongly aligned with the Aedra (Temples of the Divines, for instance) will cause all regeneration of the vampire to stop and lead to a blurred screen for as long as you tread on holy grounds

� The Dawnguard will attack you on sight if you are a vampire, regardless of your vampirism Stage

- Humanoid things will no longer drop Bottled Blood just like that when being a vampire. Instead, they will drop something just called Blood (Though the item is depicting a flask, it's not meant to be in a flask, but the remaining blood in the corpse). If you take it, it will be used immediately, counting as feeding. You can also conserve the blood by crafting a "Blood-Conserving Phial", which requires both the perks Craftmanship and Alchemistic Lore. You must be a vampire to craft it, too! If you loot "Blood" while having Blood Conserving Phials, an amount equal to the looted amount will be removed, and for each removed Phial, you'll get an Elixir of Blood. The Phial's conserving magic only works once, and thus, you cannot reuse them.

- NPCs now also are affected by a slower Fire Rate with ranged weaponry if they do not have the related perks

- To make off the slower attack speed, they now aim somewhat better again



Graphical and Aesthetic Changes:

- Lockpicks now have the same apearance in your inventory and the gameworld like in the lockpicking menu (so you do not see two kinds of lockpicks) - Thanks to born2bkilled for the permission to use this resource! :)

- The Lockpicking menu has been changed - it know has a more worn-out look and adds more to the immersion of a harsh world like Skyrim. Many thanks to quazaque for his permission to use it! :)

- Ruined books will now look less burned, but just very worn - Thanks to Ichibu for making these available as modding resources!

- The Third Person Animations of Dual Wielding have been tweaked to look more smooth and less anime-style-like


Bugfixes:

- The Ghosts called by the Augur of Dunlain during the Ritual Spell Quest should now correctly engage the player with spells


- Fixed a vanilla bug that caused the Shout "Marked for Death" to reduce armor permanently instead of the just the duration of its effect

Options added:

� Starting Skill Adjustment 0 (It was missing; now, everyone who wants to start with a base skill value of 0 can do just that ;)

Changes in 1.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Decreased the default strength of the enchantment "Fortify Magicka Regen" by about 50%

- Decreased the range of Dragons' Fear Auras by 20% and tweaked them not to affect any followers

- Decreased the magicka cost reduction of all Spell Mastery Perks to 55% (it was 75% before that)

- Decreased the amount of spells gained when investing in the Spell Mastery Perks (2 spell for all except the Masterly [Spellschool]; those only grant a single spell)

- Decreased the duration of most conjuration spells further (Depending on their mastery level, they now last between 12 and 5 seconds by default)

- Decreased the damage of most Novice level damage dealing spells

- Decreased the mastery levels of all ward spells by one level

- Decreased the amount of physical damage absorbed by wards by 10% each (It's now 50/35/25/15% taken damage while maintaining the respective rank)

- Decreased the damage of most arrows and bolts by 20 points (5 points in the editor, since all weapon damage ingame is multiplied by 4 by default with Requiem)
( This is to make ranged weapons slightly less effective when not being trained in their use - maybe it needs some more fine-tuning. Feedback regarding this would be highly appreciated! :)

- Decreased the gold reward of the delivery quest from Klimmek to 50 coins

- Decreased the reward of the quest Pilgrimage greatly - now, you only get a single Novice Restoration spell tome (Heal Self I)

- Decreased the amount of Health, Magicka and Stamina gained by leveling them up to 5 points instead of 10 (this will not work retroactively! If you wish, you can use the consol to set things right! - Also, there's an option to revert to the vanilla standard!)

- Decreased the amount of damage you can block below 33 points of stamina to only 5% of your normal amount


- Increased the poison resistance of Dragons to 80%

- Increased the Health of Dragons by 25%

- Increased the strength of Automatons: +100...200 Health, +10...25 damage with shock and steam abilities, +10% movement speed

- Increased the strength of Gargolyes: +200 Health, +4...5% max health regeneration (It cannot be interrupted), raised magic resistance to 75%

- Increased the strength of Death Hounds: +225 Health, +2% max health regeneration (It cannot be interrupted), +20% speed

- Increased the strength of Chaurus Hunters: +150 Health, +1% max health regeneration (It cannot be interrupted), +20% speed, their bite ignores poison resistance

- Increased the strength of the Forgemaster: +2500 Health, increased fire ability damage, increased stats

- Increased the strength of Frost Trolls: They regenerate +20 points of health per second

- Increased the strength of Dawnguard Members and Vampire Hunters greatly

- Increased the skill rate of Illusion to 90% of the vanilla value

- Increased the amount of money fences get from making progress in the Thief Guild questline drastically

- Increased the damage bonus from the second rank of the perk "Overdraw" slightly

- Increased the shout cooldown of the amulet of Talos to 10%

- Increased the damage of being immersed by Lava greatly

- Increased the amount of stamina consumed with each successful block by 150%


- Tweaked a few minor items (Encumbrance, price etc.)

- Changed the way skill points affect spell power:

� By default, the spell school skill level does not affect spell power at all anymore
� By buying the spell school mastery perks, the overall effect of the skill level increases. For instance:

Destruction spells do not gain any bonuses when you have no spell mastery perk.

If you have Basic Destruction, every destruction spell will be stronger: 1% more power per skill point

If you also have Advanced Destruction, every destruction spell that is higher than Novice level will be 2% more powerful per skill point

So with a skill of 100, and all the related perks, destruction spells would scale like this:

Novice: +100% power
Apprentice: +200% power
Adept: +300% power
Expert: +400% power
Master: +500% power

� Though I already tried to adjust everything to fit this new concept, some stuff in the high-end section might proof to be overpowered with this concept. If anything like that should happen, just tell me and I'll take another look! ;)
� I also tried to improve compatibility in terms of balance with other spell mods - those should now be affected by this concept, too, though it might also lead to other conflicts. Still, this approach might improve compatibility and also saves a bit of performance and maintanance time! (Before this, I manually added spells that were supposed to scale to a list - now, I only check the associated spell master perk, plus a few extra conditions to prevent certain exploits)

- Added a new rank to the ward spells, which acts as a Novice spell. Ward spells have been renamed accordingly, as there are now 4 ranks.

- The following new spells 11 have been added:

Illusion:

� Phantasmal Pain (I, II): Decreases maximum health of the target by X for Y seconds - the effect stacks. Does only work on humanoids. (The second rank has an area effect)
� Create Phantom (I, II) : Creates a Phantom that distracts enemies. The second rank also casts a stronger version of Phantasmal Pain I when it hits a target.


Conjuration:

� Summon Skeletal Warrior
� Summon Skeletal Lord
� Summon Skeletal Warlock
� Summon Skeletal Archer

� Teleport Vitals: Teleports a humanoid target's heart out of its body right into your inventory. Only works on things with less than 50% magic resistance. This spell can only be obtained through the Superior Conjuration Perk!

Restoration:

� Arcane Disjunction (I, II): These spells reduce the target's magic resistance


- Adjusted skill rates slightly (Mostly +/- 5 to 10% , Lockpicking gets an experimental 75% due to the lack of enough locks in the game world.)

- Adjusted the secondary slow effect of frost spells to 20/30/35/40/75%, depending on their mastery level

- Adjusted casting time, casting duration, cost and more minor aspects of many spells slightly

- Adjusted the duration and effect of Restore Health/MAgicka/Stamina potions: They now last twice as long, but restore only about half the amount per second. Most ingredients are also affected.

- Adjusted the effects of low quality alchemy ingredients (in general, they now are worth less and weaker)

- Frostbolt spells now deal their damage as both frost and physical damage (50/50). The frost part acts as usual, but the physical part can be resisted with armor

- The casting time of a single-handed spell now is in almost all cases tied to its mastery level - The higher the mastery level, the faster it can be cast; durations range from 0.5 seconds to 0.1 seconds

- The perk Investment Strategy has been merged with the "Merchant" perk

- The perk Allure has been merged with the perk "Silvery Tongue"

- The perk Domination no longer allows to affect undead, contructs and Daedra with Fear, Fury and Harmony Spells

- The Illusion perk tree received a new perk called "Otherworldly Deception", which requires 50 skill points and the Dual Casting perk. It allows to affect undead, constructs and Daedra with Fury, Fear and Harmony spells.

- Renamed many enchantments to fit the ones of the alchemy effects

- The Greybeard Robe now grants a 10% shouting cooldown time

- Fleshed out the "Bestiary of Skyrim" some more

- Fleshed out some other texts and load screens

- The spell Light (Rank I) is now toggable

- The spell Dispel (Rank II) now also deals damage to things animated by magic

- Rings and Necklaces made purely from metal can now be thrown into the smelter

- Alcoholic beverages do no longer have a static chance of 100% of applying the drunk visuals. Instead, it's now based on chance and on your characters Health and Stamina. For 100 points of each, the chance of getting drunk is reduced by about 10%. If the sum is about 1000, you'll never get drunk.

- Gem Dusts can now be found randomly as loot and are sometimes sold by alchemists

- Harvesting ingredients from plants no longer just gives you a single item - it now depends on its type and size

- The effect of the daedric Artifact "Sanguine Rose" now only lasts 15 seconds and drains its charge completely

- The stamina restoration granted by the second rank of improved blocking now restores 12 points of stamina over a second instead of 8 points instantly after being hit while blocking, but it only can trigger once a second, now

- The "Phantasm" perks of the Illusion perk tree now also increase the duration of affected spells by 3 seconds. These also scale with skill level.

- The spell "Animate Lockpick" now consumes one piece of Quicksilver Ore each time it is cast. Casting it without any will have no effect.

- The Ghostly Lich and the Dremora Warlock now can also summon a servant of their own (Frost Atronach/Storm Atronach)

- Added the following items to the craftable lists of smithing: Woodcutter Axe, Executioner Axe, Pickaxe

- Keening can now be tempered if you have the Legendary Blacksmithing perk and the Dwarven Blacksmithing perk

- Soul Gems now only can be used to recharge enchanted weapons if you have the perk Improved Enchantments (Rank II)! (This can be toggled with the following consol command: Set AA000XarrianSoulGemControl to 1 (O disables it again)

- Wizards now sell Scrolls of Soulgem Evocation, which can be used to circumvent the perk requirement for soulgem recharging temporarily. They can also be found randomly!

Changes in 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, a happy new year to everyone! :)

It's been quite a long time now since I released this mod (18:46, 23 Jun 2012). Before I uploaded it to the Nexus, I was mostly creating it for
myself. But I was interested if anyone would not want to use it, too - shortly after making it public, a great community started to form around the project,
and that is something I really appreciate! Without your constant help, feedback, suggestions, testing, donations and so on, this would not have been possible!
Kudos to you all! :D

Also, I am very content to announce that the mod no longer is considered to be in a BETA stage. Of course, this does not mean it's finished or completely bugfree - I still have lots of things I want to do, and 
honestly, I do not think this mod will ever truly be finished - in fact, I'd like to continue working on it for quite a long time - at least until all the DLCs are out and implemented, if not even longer.

Unfortunately, due to the always present lack of time, there are a few things this update does not feature - a very detailed readme (listing every spell, perk etc.) and a few performance/compatibility related tweaks did not (yet) make it.
But - along with a lot of other things - they still are on my always growing to - do list for the next year! :)

But I'll keep it short - here's what's changed:


- Shock Glass, Ebony, Daedric and Ebony arrows now deal three times their damage to dwemer automatons

- Mage Armor spells now profit more from their related perks

- Added Silver Arrows to more random loot lists

- The damage of Silver Arrows and Bolts now equals that of their steel counterparts

- Tweaked the Master Thief Armor some more

- The sneak penalty you get when wearing heavy armor has been increased greatly

- The Variable DLC1VQMinLevel has been set to 30 - this means that the Dawnguard should not seek you out if you're below level 30. Prior to this, it was 10. You can still start the quest on any level, though, but that is not considered to be very healthy! ;)

- Renamed Gold to Septim (This only affects the item for now, due to restrictions)

- Werewolves now receive double the health bonus (+1000)

- The reach of the Ebony Blade has been increased by 30%

- Increased the Range of Dragon Fear Auras somewhat

- The mace of Molag Bal now deals less damage

- General Tullius now uses the Imperial Hero Armor from Lorefriendly Armors

- The former Armor of General Tullius is now used by some other high ranking Imperial Leaders

- Paralysing Poisons now only work on things with less than 75% resistance

- The Terminate Undead spells have been replaced with the Sun Fire spells, which have also been tweaked

- The Accuracy of NPC archers has been decreased again

- The damage the Summon Swarm spells deal has been increased greatly (even more when having the related perk, which has been removed)

- Summon Swarm spells can no longer be absorbed

- Increased the power of the spell "Summon Ghostly Hound" and added it to the list of gained perks when choosing the Advanced Conjuration perk

- Some Novice Level spells no longer scale in Magnitude with the skill level (Firesparks, Icewind, Lightning Sparks, Summon Swarm I & II, and Mage Armor I)

- Dawnguard weapons are now considered to be made out of a silver alloy, thus dealing more damage against all undead and have been tweaked some more

- The base duration of all summoning spells has been decreased greatly, depending on their spell level

- Tweaked some more loot lists

- The spell telekinetic Nova now uses teh same resistance thresholds as Fus Ro (less than 36% magic resistance, less than 400 points of health) and has been halved in damage hand range and increased a bit in its cost

- Rebalanced all Summong spells' magicka cost

- Decreased the sneak attack penalties for trying to sneak attack with ranged weaponry over longer distances in relation to the archery skill level

- Cutting down spider webs will no longer cause the player to be staggered

- Added a few more conditions to smelter recipes so most only pop up if you carry anything that can be smelt down

- Ebony, Glass and Draugr equipment can now be used at the smelter to create ingots (Draugr equipment yields Corundum)

- Increased the damage of Novice Destruction spells a bit

- Decreased the high range - low skill penalties when using ranged weaponry by about 15%

- Alduin is now immune to the instant kill effect of Mehrunes Razor

- Alduin in Sovngard now regenerates health slightly slower (35 points per second), and it stops completely if he's affected by the shout "Dragonrend"

- Alduin's special ability in Sovngard now has a cooldown of 30 seconds


- The Perk "Legendary Blacksmithing" now also allows to temper Artifacts if you also have the related perk for the material

- The Perk Endurance has been renamed to Windrunner and now only increases stamina regeneration while you are not running or sprinting. However, it also causes your stamina not to be drained anymore when running.

- The Perk Elemental Binding will now also cause your Fire/Frost/Storm Thralls to be unbanishable or controllable via respective spells

- The perks "Arcane Experimentation" and "Artificer's Insight" now both grant a 15% enchantment strength bonus


- The lockpicking perk tree has been overhauled: It now only consists of three main perks and two unassociated ones:

� Basic Lockpicking: Allows to pick Novice and Apprentice Locks
� Skilled Lockpicking: Allows to pick Adept and Expert Locks
� Masterly Lockpicking: Allows to pick master locks and positions your pick close to the lock's sweet spot

� Self Sufficient: You can smelt steel ingots into picks

� Treasure Hunter: Increases found loot

If you already had other perks, you might have to remove them from your character with the consol to avoid weird glitches! The ones affected have the following vanilla names: Expert Locks, Master Locks


- The skill Rate of Pickpocketing has been decreased by 10%

- Further increased the following skill gain rates (by 5 to 10%): Onehanded, Twohanded, Marksman, Heavy Armor, Conjuration, Illusion, Alchemy, Lockpicking, Sneaking

� Vanilla Sleeping (Enables health gain when sleeping like in vanilla)

Consol Command: Set AA000XarrianVanillaSleepingControl to 1 (0 disables it again)


Changes in 0.999
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Experimental tweaks to Bashing (All these things only come through if the bash has not been blocked):

� Bashes now do not stagger anything by default

� Certain creatures will not be staggered by bashes at all anymore

� Bashes only stagger when your timing is right and you hit something that is trying to attack. Fast attacks, however, are extremely hard to counter, as you need to bash almost the moment the animation starts. It's more economic to wait for an opening when the enemy tries to powerattack you or uses slower weapons.

� Shield Bashes will knock down things with less than 75 health points and no other form of greater protection (Armor rating greater than 300, an active ward spell)

� Shield Bashes will knock down things that do have no weapon or just a spell equipped in their main hand (no Armor rating greater than 300, no active ward spell, less than 150 Health points)

� Most Marksmen will always be disarmed when being bashed (This does only count when bashed by the player, currently, due to technical reasons)

� Shield  Power Bashes have a chance to knock down weak enemies (if they have less than 250 Health and less than 300 points of armor - the chance is 50%. If the enemy only has 150 or less, the chance is 100%)

� The Shield Power bash knockdown gets improved if you have the Deadly Bash perk (Then, the conditions are less than 350 Health, less than 350 Armor and the chance is 75%)

As said, these tweaks are experimental! Let me know how it plays out! I am most positive this system will need some more fine-tuning, but it's structure should allow easy and comfortable hotifxes, so here's no risk of breaking things permanently should this prove to be more a curse than a blessing! 


- Experimental tweaks to tune down the range at which NPCs become aggro-ed

- Experimental tweaks to the sneaking system to tune down the impact of sound and general difficulty ( I am not sure if this is perfect, but my tests were way better than how it was before these tweaks. It might be too easy, now, though - it's just very hard to judge how it works out, since the settings are not fully documented, and behave somewhat strangely - Feel free to tell me how these tweaks play out, as said, it's experimental!)


- Carrying an artifact of Meridia as a vampire will now result in an instant death (due to technical problems with the damage over time solution). Also, it is now possible to place such an artifact on a vampire via reversed pickpocketing, thus killing him or her instantly!

- All "Summon Ghostly X" spells are no longer ritual spells

- Wrathmen can now use a Drain Vitality Shout

- The Rueful Axe now uses the model of the Headsman's Axe

- The Ebony Mail now also makes you immune against poisons

- Raised Undead now get a high frost and shock resistance plus some other bonuses by default, but also a weakness to fire

- Due to technical problems, Raised Undead are not resistant to arrows (As I figured out, the tweak that was supposed to make them did not work due to them ignoring the perk that should be added to them)

- Removed the Knockdown of the non-Powerattacks of Giants due to some weird glitch regarding the range they were applied on

- Rearranged certain exterior encounters

- The Jarl of Whiterun will no longer give the player any armor as the second reward, instead you now only receive the Resist Potions, to which one Restore Full Health potion has been added

- Removed Enchanted Arrows from random Iron and Steel arrows (this should finally make these almost unused by any bandit or hunter, Thalmor remain unaffected)

- All weapons acquired during Thane Quests now use the models of the Nord Hero Set and have been tweaked greatly

- Skeletons now are dealt bonus damage from silver arrows

- All Turn Undead enchantments have been tweaked: They now deal unresistable damage to undead, but have a decreased turn duration of only 5 seconds, but can now affect higher levels by default.

- All alcohol now actually makes you drunk in terms of vision 

- Being poisoned will most often result in a very blurred vision. You'll hate spiders more than ever! Now where's that potion of poison resistance again???

- Being diseased will also lead to more or less vexing visual effects

- Ward spells most NPCs use are now just as good as those the player can use

- Tweaked Dragons so that they have a more diversified preference of used shouts: Some use the continous breath attack, while others prefer to use their higher damaging Fireball or Icestorm shouts

- Added a second rank to shock enchantments: These also deal additional unresistable damage against all dwarven constructs

- Removed the perk "Heavy Impact" from the twohanded tree and put its effects into the Great Weapon Mastery Perk

- The perks Strong Grip and Deflection have been merged

- The perks Mysticism and Exorcism have been merged

- The perks Juggernaught and Resilience have been merged

- The two ranks of Extended Binding have been merged into one single rank

- Removed the Sleeping penalty for wearing armor (for now)


- Increased the power of the Thief Master Armor

- Increased the number of enemies at some locations in Skuldafn

- Increased the power of Alduin in the last battle in Sovngarde (Doubled his health, slightly increased resistances, gave him a high health regeneration, as well as more shouts, along with a unique that will be a nasty surprise!)

- Fixed a bug that caused the Bestial Stew not to grant its stamina regeneration

- Fixed a bug that caused vampires not to be able to sleep (It might be required to remove a certain ability with the consol and then add it again to make this work due to how the engine handles it: Player.RemoveSpell ED0A8 and then Player.AddSpell ED0A8 should do the trick)

Changes in 0.9976

� If it is used on a weak paralysed target, it will catapult it randomly through the air

- Fleshed out the easteregg of the previous update some more...

- Most Fear/Calm/Fury effects now can be resisted with Magic Resistance - the better the spell, the higher the threshold needed:

Rank I spells: 15%+ to resist

Rank II spells: 50%+ to resist

Rank III + IV spells: magic resistance is ignored

Alchemic effects: 25%+ to resist

Enchantments: 25%+ to resist

- Made some weapons and armor cursed. Using these will have severe disadvantages to them...

- If a ranged weapon is broken, a few reusable materials will still be scavengable

- Added a new spell called "Dominate Nature" to the Illusion Expert perk - it basically allows you to avoid aggressive contact with most animals when you do not provoke them.

- Increased the difficulty of Meridia's Quest

- Added a new set of Armor: The Aetherium Set, which is based on the mod Dwarven Dwemer Power Armor by lautasantenni. It is a major artifact left behind from the dwemer cities that were once ruling over the Aetherium Forge, and only a single handplaced set exits, which is obviously hard to acquire, but it still is worth the trouble!

- Added some selected sets from Immersive Armors (Some Alik'r now wear Hammerfell Chaimail, Galmar received a unique armor, a certain drunken Bandit got a nice, stolen piece of unique Plate Armor, and Alain Dufont also wears a unique piece of armor)
Of course, all sets are temperable!


- Added an empty video file that causes the Bethesda Intro to be skipped - a few seconds less to enter your favourite game! :)

Changes in 0.9975
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Experimental Balancing tweak regarding archery:

� If you manage to hit an archer in melee, you will destroy his ranged weapon if it is not made mainly out of metal. Elven, Dwarven, Orcish, Glass, Ebony and Daedric Bows cannot be broken (for now).

� If you are hit by a melee attack while having a bow equipped that is not of the above listed material, it will also be torn apart.

This whole thing can be toggled on and off with the following consol command:

Set AA000XarrianTearingBowsControl to 1 (0 enables it again)

- Dark Brotherhood Armor is now considered to be made of Leather (It was missing material type keywords due to a vanilla bug)

- Meridia's Quest will not start if you are a vampire

- Again changed the effect of reading the Oghma Infinium:

Instead of granting any skill points, it now grants an additional 2 perk points (now it's 7 points) and increases the attribute associated with the chosen path by 200 points. Also fleshed out its activation message.

Changes in 0.9974
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added a major, but still lorefriendly easter egg I am quite happy to announce:

A somewhat hidden cave has been added to the path behind the Greybeard Monastery that leads further up to Mount Hrothgar, where a secluded, but mad greybeard hermit resides. 

To those who know Monty Python, especially John Cleese: You'll love it! For all others: The one you find obviously is a Sheogorath worshipper! :P

Some clarification: I am quite a fan of John Cleese's work, and in a video I just found a few days ago, he claimed that he'd like to be a Greybeard in Skyrim. Now I had to do something about that! (Here's the video, for all those who are interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Afv3U_ysc - it's at the minute 3:20 and on!)


- Added a few Wait functions to the script that should give you three free perk points at the start - this might fix the problem that some people do not receive it even if the script fires correctly (it seems to be an issue with the function not working properly on all systems for whatever reason, if this does not help, I'll try some more complex workarounds)
With the new tweaks, you'll receive the perks about 20 seconds after starting!

- Added two new spells: Terminate Undead (Rank I + II) - Restoration, 25, 50, achieved with the related perks. They deal extreme damage to undead things.

- Edited the rewards of some quests

- Sinding now correctly gains all benefits from being a werewolf

- Exchanged the armor ratings and prices of scale Armor and Elven Armor (this decision is lore based)

- Exchanged the armor ratings and prices of Dwarven Armor and Steel Plate Armor (this decision is lore based)

- Steel Plate Armor now is made craftable by the perk "Advanced Blacksmithing"

- The Perk "Blacksmithing Lore" has been renamed to Orcish Smithing and has been swapped with Dwarven Smithing to their original positions.

- Removed all Light related changes again


- Increased the power of the Archmage Robes greatly

- Increased the sound running causes by 50%

Changes in 0.9973
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You can no longer craft your own lockpicks at a forge with the Perk "Self-Sufficient", but you can at a smelter. (This is meant to prevent skill gain exploits, as reports have stated it seems to be just like that)

- The Bandit Boss in Duskglow Crevice is now considered a small Mini-Boss, being elevated to being the tiwn brother of Halvar the Drunk - Halvar the Other!

- The spell Arcane ward (Rank II) is now able to sometimes reflect spells (30%) that do not break it. They are then shot in the direction the caster is facing, so aiming is still necessary!

- The spell Arcane ward (Rank III) is now able to also reflect spells that do not break it. They are then shot in the direction the caster is facing, so aiming is still necessary!

- Added a new perk: Reflective Wards (Restoration, 100) - It doubles the damage reflected spells deal.

- Every character now receives 3 perks to spend from the start on (These are handed out retroactively, so even if you do not start all over again, you get these! ;)

- Fixed some minor bugs



Changes in 0.9972
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Spell costs are now much less affected by your skill. With a skill of 100, they were lowered to 65%, now, it is only 90%.

- The main perks to decrease spell cost now do not decrease your spell cost by 50%, but by 80%. 

- These two changes will make spells much more expensive for those without the perks, but those who have them can actually cast them with a slightly reduced cost compared to what it costs now.


- A new perk with no "Normal" requirements in the restoration tree:

� Painful Regrets: The character can still gain a Cure (Disease, Poison, temp. magic effects) at all shrines despite any crimes as long as they do not stress the new limit of a total lifetime bounty of 6000 Gold, 20 stolen items or 2 murders). However, your character will permanently suffer from the tormentation of the regrets, which lead to 15% increased spell cost, 20% to 40% worse prices at vendors, slightly increased power attack costs and an overall reduced skillgain of only 85%.
This perk does not make the other parts of a gods blessing available, though! Those are only for the truly devoted!

The perk can be taken as soon as your character has achieved one of the permanent conditions which render shrines unusuable (This does not cover joining the Dark Brotherhood or the Thieves Guild).


- Handplaced more very small Frostbite Spiders (134) and also tweaked their stats.

- Skeletons now come in a greater variety, sometimes wearing armor. 

- Chaurus will use their spit attack more often.


- The Bandits at the Valtheim Towers have become much more aggressive and stronger in numbers and equipment - they no longer want a toll, they want whatever you have, including your very life! Be careful when trying to use that road!


- Increased the speed of Chaurus Hunters

- Decreased the Duration of the Spell "Mage Armor V" to 12 seconds. !

- Decreased the damage of the shout Unrelenting Force by about 50%.

- Decreased sneaking difficulty somewhat again.

- Decreased the field of view of NPCs to 155�.

- Decreased the Health points bonus of the perk Dark Infusion by half. This will also make things raised by most vampires easier to defeat. (If they seem to be immortal, it's because their Health bar does not depict the additional Health from the perk. Nothing I can do about that, it's something with the engine itself.)

- Decreased the difficulty of Dragon Priests slightly.

- Decreased the chance of pickpocketing from someone who has detected you to 0%.


- Highelves now gain 5% overall reduced spell cost, 10% increased range, 5% more duration and 5% more power by default and a somewhat higher magicka regen rate.



- Fixed some minor bugs

- Fixed some lighting issues

- Fixed some spelling mistakes

- Fixed some issues with ingredients

- Fixed some problems with Skeleton NPCs

- Fixed a problem with Chaurus Hunter loot lists

- Fixed some issues with Bandits attacking random critters and other more or less harmless creatures on sight. No idea why they did that in the first place, but now, they should treat those things as Neutral and will not attack them unless provoked.

Changes in 0.995
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The Racial Power of Redguards now only lasts 30 seconds, but it increases stamina regeneration even more and also slows down time slightly

- If your stamina is almost depleted, your dealt weapon damage will be decreased by half

- The weight of arrows has been adjusted. Most arrows and Bolts now have a weight of 0.2, Glass, Forsworn and Elven have a weight of 0.1, Orcish and Dwemer have one of 0.3, and Ebony and Daedric one of 0.5.

Also, enchanted arrows and all others that fall not into the above category now have a weight of 0.1!

Besides, custom arrows from other mods will now also receive weight if they have the Arrow Keyword assigned to them!

Since this is handled via a script, this change will only affect new savegames!


- Wearing any armor (light or heavy) increases spell cost by 8% per piece. This penalty is static and cannot be reduced. In the case of Heavy Armor, it's additional to the one already in place.

- Allies will turn hostile after two hits, not four

- Added a new speechcraft perk:

� One as Many (100 Speechcraft, requires Silvery Tongue) - You can disguise yourself as a faction member of certain selected factions when wearing at least the cuirass/robe associated with it. Currently supported factions are: Bandits, Necromancers, Warlocks, Forsworn (Restricted to Bretons), Stormcloaks, Imperials, Thalmor (Restricted to Highelves). To disguise yourself, just equip the related item while no one can see you while being out of combat. As long as you wear the item, you are considered to be a faction member, but be careful! Certain Spellcasters might look through your disguise and blow it, and any hostile action will also blow your disguise - unfortunately, this means if you disguise yourself and run into a random animal encounter that starts combat, your disguise is also considered blown, so you'd need to reequip it after that fight. I know, it sucks, but there just doesn't seem to be a better workaround. At best, you first try to get as close to your target destination as possible before disguising yourself. Unequipping the related item will also remove you from the related faction instantly.

- Added an Illusion spell that also allows to paralze opponents, but it can only be acquired with the Perk "Undisbelievable Illusions"

- Reverted the absorb amount of the Atronach sign to the default value again

- Halved the duration of an Orcs Berserk Ability, but it also does increase stamina by 700 points for 30 seconds, now. This means that they can also break every breakable lock from the beginning.

- Thalmor Melee Fighters are now a bit tougher in terms of Hit Points, and Thalmor Wizards should use some more spells. All in all, they received some more improvements in terms of perks and skills.

- A lot of equipment can now be smelted down at the smelter. The recipes only show up when you actually carry something smeltable, though, and can also be turned off entirely with the respective option!

- The Spells "Silence (Rank I, II)" are now considered Expert Level Spells.

- Doubled the Time Scale Value. Now, one real time minute will equal 10 ingame minutes, not 5.

- Trippled the chance of certain NPCs applying their poison to the player.

- In order to be able to have a chance to successfully pickpocket, you do now need to have at least the first rank of the perk "Nimble Fingers". An option has been included to turn this off again:

Set AA000XarrianPickpocketBarrierControl to 1 (o enables it again)

- Slightly altered some more leveled lists

- Slightly altered Helgen Keep

- Sneak-Attacking a sleeping humanoid will always lead to a lethal result

- Fortify Light/Heavy Armor enchantments and alchemy effects now increase the armor rating directly instead

- High Level NPC spellcasters and some other characters now possess a unique ability. They telepathically monitor their sorrounding area at all times and are able to also telepahtically alert sorrounding allies of the player's presence (Technically, you get a tremendous Detection penalty when being close to these individuals) - however, a Muffle Enchantment/Spell can counter these effects.

- The spell Raise Dead V has been improved so that it can raise about everything...

- Halved the max carry weight bonus Bags of Holding grant

- Increased the necessary amount of gold pieces to make a gold ingot by 100%

- Increased the skill rate of smithing

- Decreased the chance of randomly encountering any enchanted arrows

- Decreased the loot more common boss chests yield

- Fixed some issues related to the Vampire Lord (Bonuses and Penalties should now be applied correctly)

- Fixed some spelling mistakes

- Fixed some minor bugs



Added the following options:

� Resting Bonus for Skill Rates - Greatly increases the skill rate bonuses you get for sleeping



Changes in 0.992
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Elven, Glass and Dragonscale Armor now also protect from arrows, though the effect is much less effective than that of Heavy Armor! Other light armor types remain unaffected!

- Silver Weapons can now be tempered

- Increased the Cooldown of Iceform and decreased its paralysis effect duration

- The perk "Precise Aim" now grants a stronger zoom and removed its passive damage bonus again

- Lowered the Skill Rate bonuses from resting to +5/15/25%

- Lowered the necessary resistance to withstand the Shout Iceform - you now just need more than 50% frost resistance

- Lowered the chance that highly experienced blacksmiths have Glass or Ebony equipment for sale and the amount of more advanced smithing books at them.

- Handplaced some more Blacksmithing books.

- Added a key to Gallows Rock that can open all chests in that dungeon

- The Perks "Perfected Art", "Cutpurse" and "Nimble Fingers" only grant tehir bonuses when the target you're stealing from cannot see you.

- The NPC "Astrid" is now much more powerful

- The "Lost Knife Hideout" is now home to a new mini-boss...

- The Quest "Mind of Madness" will now be harder to accomplish. Suitable Alterations to the Pelagius Wing have been made...

- The Quest "Waking Nightmare" will now be harder to accomplish. Suitable Alterations to the Orcish Invaders have been made...

- The Quest "House of Horrors" will now be harder to accomplish. Suitable Alterations to the Tyranus have been made...

- The item "Necromancer's Amulet" will quickly drain Health, Magicka and Stamina when worn by someone below who'S MAgicka has not been leveled up to 300 or more. Also, black soulgems can now only be created with it between 23 and 24 PM.

- Decreased the passive magic resistance from Bretons to 15%

- Fixed some spelling mistakes

- Fixed a bug with the Spell "Phantasmal Killer (Rank III)

- Fixed a bug that caused certain Silverhand Members to still use Iron or Steel weapons

- Fixed the weight of Elven Longswords

- Fixed a bug with crossbows - Bethesda's stock script does not remove the armor penetration effect again when unequipped (I did not notice this in the first place since they cannot opened by default, you first have to make some tweaks I did not know of), which probably caused quite some miscalculations with characters who used a crossbow. This should now work properly. Just to be sure, if your character ever used a crossbow, you might want to equip one and then unequip it again.

- More performance tweaks that should further reduce any script lags and FPS loss





- Added new optional files:

� Vanilla Death Cam (Resets the reload time after dying to the vanilla amount of 5 seconds again)

Changes in 0.99
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Experimental Performance Tweaks:

Decreased the updates of scripts constantly used by about 66% - this should decrease any script lag that may result from other script intensive contents.

However, this may not work on old savegames, but since it all runs fine anyways in most cases, it's not that critical that it's a real drawback not to get it.

Also, I am not sure if any problems might result with this tweak - affected features are:

� Passive Armor skill gain
� Fast Travelling
� Weapon Dropping
� Random Dawnguard Vampire Spawns


- Decreased the carry weight bonus vampires get greatly

- Added the following spells:

� Umbral Sanctuary (Rank II) - Illusion, Master, obtainable only by perks - It works just as Umbral Sanctuary (Rank I), but is instead targeted and channeled on a single actor 

� Ward (Rank II) now also renders the caster immune to many paralysis effects as long as it is maintained.

� Ward (Rank III) now also renders the caster immune to many paralysis and life drain effects as long as it is maintained.

� Waterbreathing now also negates any stamina penalties when swimming, even wearing heavy armor. (This might not work on current savegames, though, due to how the engine handles the stamina drain effect used for the feature)


- Altered the following enchantments:

� Fortify Stamina is now available in two ranks; the second one also rendering the target immune to most paralysis effects.

� Waterbreathing now also negates any stamina penalties when swimming, even wearing heavy armor. (This might not work on current savegames, though, due to how the engine handles the stamina drain effect used for the feature)



- Altered the following perks:

� Poison Placement has been merged with the 2. rank of Nimble Fingers

� Keymaster has been merged with Cutpurse

� The required perks for Perfected Art have been adjusted


� Arcane Thesis is now called Artificer's Insight



- Added some more size variations to certain creatures

- Added two sets of playable Greybeard Robes (one to High Hrothgar, one in Ustengrav)

- Greatly improved the Sword of Lord Harkon

- Saddled Horses can now be used as storage - whenever you mount or dismount them while you do not have anything equipped to your right hand, their inventory screen will pop up where you can manage everything to your liking. (Please tell me if it is too tedious or if it feels alright - I did not yet find a more "comfortable" way to include this without making use of any third party programs.)

- Handplaced another unique Mini-Boss encounter with unique loot.

- Further decreased the value of self crafted poisons that deal damage over time. This also fixes the too large amount of skill gained when working with Dremora Hearts.

- The Perk "Soulgem Mastery" now allows to craft Soulgems at a forge from Moonstoon and Quicksilver ingots. If you have the perk, you can craft better soulgems the better your skill level.

- You can also craft Black Soulgems at a forge if you have the Perk "Soulgem Mastery" and an enchantment skill level of 100. But you also need the Necromancer's Amulet in your possesion to do that. The ingredients are a Grand Soulgem and a Human Skull.

- When you possess the Wabbajack (Meaning if it's currently in your inventory), you can now turn regular Tomatos into Soul Tomatos at the cooking pot. Soul Tomatoes are working just like black soulgems, they only weigh less and are, well, tomatos. Try to eat them with cheese and a Sweetroll! Sheogorath approves it! :D

- Vampires and Werewolves also get the Strong Stomach Feature

- Further lowered the chance of finding Orcish, Elven and Dwarven equipment randomly

- Fixed some spelling mistakes

- Fixed some minor bugs with loot lists

- Fixed some minor placement bugs

- Fixed and cleaned some unneccassary entries

- Fixed the dragon's fear aura effect to be unabsorbable

- Fixed an issue with too many vampires wearing ebony armor

- Fixed a bug that seems to have caused wearing Heavy Armor to also increase the charge amount of certain enchantments (e.g. The Mace of Molag Bal) - But I must say, I am not quite sure if it will work. If it does not, please report it! :)

Changes in 0.988
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added a few more small things to Helgen Keep...

- Decreased the Health of most Dragons by half

- Decreased the cost of player houses greatly (On one hand, to make it less a pain to find a way to carry that much gold, and on the other hand, I think it seems appropriate for a Thane to get a proper discount for the basic building)

- Decreased the ranged damage of dwarven Spheres

- Decreased the necessary amount of resistance to not get frozen by certain frost spells (You now need only 70 points of frost resistance or 50 magic resistance)

- The optional file "Requiem - Difficulty Bar Restored" has been adjusted. The difficulty setting won't affect the amount of damage the player deals, but only decreases the amount the player takes. The damage is dealt as follows now:

Master: 100%
Expert:  75%
Adept :  50%
Appr. :  20%
Novice:  10%

- Decreased the Health of Alduin greatly

- Reduced the frequency random dragons (re)spawn greatly (WiWaitDragon is 3 by default, I set it to 12. If I am correct, this should mean you should only encounter a random dragon every 12 ingame days or so, though I am not entirely sure if this one global suffices)

- Rebalanced the Weight of some items (Especially Glass Equipment)

- Adjusted the Vendor Gunmar of the Dawnguard - he should sell plenty of bolts now

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Again increased the protection of Heavy Armor slightly

- Woodelfs can now cannibalize their slain enemies: In most cases, foes you kill will drop "Strange Meat", which will grant you exceptional bonuses (this is based on lore, look for the "Greenpact") - In some cases, however, they might not, or you might end up being able to pickpocket some. In that case, take it either as they do not taste that good or that they are a little cannibalistic themselves - It's the best results possible to get, I think!

- Woodelfs now also receive the Strong Stomach feature

- Namiras ring is now worthy to be called a Daedric Artifact

- Added more options controllable through consol commands:

- Increased the value of some more items

- Mudcrabs now have a chance based on their size to drop some pearls

- Added a new item: Healing Mush - a traditional yet simple medicine that can be created by about anyone. It consists of ale (1), tundra cutton (3) and blue mountain flowers (3) and can be crafted at the tanning rack - it's so common that every alchemist always has at least a dozen of these in stock.
It works still via magic, as the mixture is based on the healing properties of the flowers.
It's works by applying the mush on the wound, after which the mush will slightly harden, making compresses and bandages somewhat unneccassry under harsher circumstances.
However, physical stress will surpress it from apllying its healing effects: Sprinting, Swimming and Fighting will stop the healing effect temporarily until its over.

- Decreased the player's spell damage skill bonus by 33% and that of NPCs by 50%. [This is very experimental, please give me some feedback about overall balance!!!]

- I edited a value (DLC1VQMinLevelVampireAttacks) which I think of that it controls the random vamire attacks so these attacks start only if your character is at least on level 999 - which effectively should disable them completely. I also added a script that continously resets certain EclipseAttack variables that seem to be responsible for the attacks. [If you still encounter vampire attacks, please inform me about it!!!]

- Added some triggerplates to certain dwemer ruins

Changes in 0.978
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You now cannot change your armor during combat. Doing so will make your character drop his current apparel and not being able to equip it again. This does not apply to rings and amulets.

- The Perk "Necromancy" is now available at skill level 25 instead of 50

- The Perk "Mage Armor" now only consists of one single perk

- The Mage Armor spells have been made weaker, and the perk bonuses have been made smaller (the maximum effect possible with the MAge Armor perk, skill level 100 and the best spell is +350 armor)

- Some bandits, Thalmor, many Vampires and all Alik'r now make use of potent poisons based on the one spiders use, so be careful - as they now all might paralyse you! Argonians and Redguards will rejoice, for they generally are not affect by these, for now.

- Guards now have measures to defend them against spiders effectively

Changes in 0.976
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Dwarven Automatons do receive almost normal damage from all daedric weapons

- Increased the Health of Frost Atronachs slightly

- Increased the magicka cost of several Conjuration Spells

- Decreased the damage of rune spells by about halve

- Renamed the Perk Arcane Disruption to Electrostatic Discharge

+ Minor Bugfixes



Changes in 0.975
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added many Elemental Arrows (They deal higher base damage, plus elemental damage, plus have no weight, and are not affected by gravity very much)

- Added Silver Arrows and Silver Bolts (they deal very low damage to normal enemies, but are able to hurt Draugr. They can be crafted at a forge, be found in the game world or most likely be obtained from Dawnguard Crossbowers and Silverhand Archers)

- Added some forging receips (especially Elemental Arrows (it requires the respective perk))

- Added some receips to the smelter (Death Hound Collars can be smelted down to get Steel)

- Added some custom items to random lootlists (Enchanted Arrows, Oils)

- Added some touchspells (Fire, Ice, Shock, Poison)

- Added about 50% sneak attack bonus damage (scales with your skill level) to single-targeted damage spells (Touch Spells and most single-target projectile spells like Firebolt, Ice Bolt, Lightning Bolt and Toxic Blast - however, these effects do also only work against opponents you could sneak attack with physical weapons and only when you are within 800 units of the target [a greatsword seems to have about the length of 100 units. However, this feature is absolutely silent, so you will not really notice it except for the higher damage. This also applies to spells from staffs and scrolls)

- Arrows now penetrate armor based on their quality (Iron and Steel arrows do not penetrate it at all and while daedric arrows will set it down to 45% - if you use a daedric bow, too, it's already at 22,5% - so if you are an archer, most things can say goodbye to their armor)

- Fixed some spelling mistakes and changed some more messages or removed them completly

- Fixed the damage of pre-placed trap runes - they now deal static damage (and much more)

- Fixed some issues with Hadvar and Ralof and the spiders in the tutorial

- Fixed a bug that allowed certain undead to be sneak attacked

- Fixed some minor bugs

- Fixed the bashing exploit with a rather temporary solution (as the mechanic itself is from Bethesda themselves and it seems to be very hard to be used with conditions): When you bash an enemy without having enough stamina to pay the full cost (40 points), the opponent will be healed completely and rendered invulnerable for 3 seconds. I am pretty sorry about this, but at the moment, I do not have another working option, as the spell effects needed to produce something else (like your shield and weapon dropping or the player tripping) seem to be working incorrectly (contact spells seem not to execute scripts properly, which makes it hard for me to make something more believable, in fact, many spell effects also seem not to work on them at all - if you have any information on this matter, please inform me - this thing also prevents me from further tweaking the combat mechanics!!!)

- Removed a Damage Stamina Rate from one magic effect - this might fix the No Stamina Regen glitch, though I am not sure about that one

- Arrows and bolts should now behave a little more physically accurate - their gravity pull has been increased so you'll need to aim higher to hit on longer range (might require some more tweaks, if anyone is into real life archery, I am open to suggestions! :) )

- Decreased the chance of meeting archers in the following factions: Bandits, Alik'r, Afflicted

- Decreased the amount of consumed stamina when blocking

- Decreased armor values globally by about 20%

- Decreased the armor penetration default value for ranged attacks over short distances further to 25%

- Decreased the effect of armor spells, but increased their values when perked

- The Mask of Clavicus Vile now is considered Heavy Armor

- Thalmor Mages now carry around Elven Longswords instead of Daggers

- Dawnbreaker now has only a small chance to use its strongest power - however, it also deals more damage to undead things by default, while its base damage has been decreased. It also has a small chance to deal a great amount of damage to any undead target and also fears weaker undead shortly with every hit.

- Increased the spell damage of elemental bolts from Dawnguard

- Increased the damage from many fire hazards greatly

- Increased the armor values of certain creatures by 10% to 75% (Draugr, Mudcrabs, Spiders)

- Minor tweaks to existing crafting receips

- The Perk "Perfected Art" now gives you a 100% success chance when pickpocketing, however, you need to have all other pickpocketing perks before being able to choose it

- The Perk "Improved Block" refreshes your stamina by 12 points whenever you take a hit while blocking if you have reached the second rank of the perk.

- The Perk "Runemastery" now requires you to know all Rune (Rank I) spells in order to be obtained

- Made some crossbows slightly stronger than others

- Increased the global armor scaling factor for NPCs by 0.25 points

- Reduced the loot giants yield

- Most Draugrs will now use a weaker form of unrelenting force, though some remain who use the strongest version. Remember: Having more than 50% magic resistance protects against all versions!

- Decreased the chance of meeting the strongest draugr by halve

- The Shout Unrelenting Force does not work on targets with an exceptionally high health

- The Shout Disarm can be resisted with a high enough Magic Resistance (25/35/50) or with a high enough stamina (250/400/600)

- The Spell Animate Lockpick now is considered an Adept Level spell with increased casting cost

- The Spell Summon Ghostly Steed now can only be bought after completing the Ritual Spell Quest for Conjuration - except if you go for perks, then you get it with the Adept level perk

- The Spell Transmute: Fists now is called Transmute: Muscles and increases Health and Carrying capacity besides the unarmed damage bonus

- Added Armor Breaking Properties to some more enemies (examples: Trolls, Large Spiders, Bears, Sabrecats)

- Vampires will more often use maces as their prefered weapons and much more rarely rely on daggers

- Changed the effects of almost all alcoholic drinks some more so that they do increase stamina regen rate and decrease magicka regen rate

- Dragons now deal about much less damage (about 350, except for alduin who still deals a 1000 with one blow)

- Removed the dragon melee damage reduction from armor

- Dwarven Spheres and Spiders now get the correct damage reduction perk (due to me setting a wrong value, it was 25% reduction, now it is as intended with 75% physical damage reduction)

- The worn armor now only affects Alduin (each piece of the following materials (Glass, Ebony, Daedric, Dragonscale, Dragonplate) reduces the damage he deals to you (the combination does not matter any more) - however, Glass Armor protects not as good as the others!

- Tweaks to the movement mechanism:

� Running now consumes 0.25 stamina per second
� Running also disables magicka regeneration and actually drains it very, very slowly
� Swimming will drain your stamina by 2.5 points per second

These penalties do not apply if you are undead (a vampire)!


- Major Combat Tweaks:

� If you wear a full set of heavy armor, you're now also able to tackle some opponents
� If you fullfill both tackling conditions, you will get a stronger tackling effect
� Your character will now only try to tackle down hostile NPCs


� Whenever you're hit by anything, you lose 5 points of stamina and 10 points of magicka
� Whenever you're hit by a bow, crossbow, projectile or twohanded weapon, you lose an additional 5 stamina and 10 magicka

This does not happen when one of the following is true:

- You are currently blocking
- You wear a full set of heavy armor (shield NOT included)
- You wear a full set of glass or dragonscale armor (shield NOT included)
- You are undead (this is true when you are a vampire)
- You are currently using a Ward Spell
- You are using the spell Mage Armor V
- You possess the perk Resilience


� Whenever you're hit by anything, there's a 50% chance that you will become staggered
� Whenever you're hit by a bow, crossbow or twohanded weapon, you will always be staggered

(This will only make the camera shake, you still can maintain your block, but it might become a little more difficult if you fight more than one or two opponents at once)

This does not happen when one of the following is true:

- You are currently blocking
- You wear a full set of heavy armor (shield NOT included)
- You wear a full set of glass or dragonscale armor (shield NOT included)
- You are undead (this is true when you are a vampire)
- You are currently using a Ward Spell
- You are using the spell Mage Armor V
- You possess the perk Resilience



- New optional files:

� Standard casting of continued spells (so they do not shoot once for 3 seconds, but work like in vanilla skyrim again - this enables all related exploits again, though!)

� Less NPC Spell Damage


- Updated the Non-Dawnguard Version 0.94 to 0.941:

� Removed the arrow weight script
� Added the following optional files: Saving Messages Restored, Global Damage Modifiers, Less NPC Spell Damage


Changes in 0.97
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The helmets and cuirasses guards wear are now considered heavy armor

- Reintegrated passive Armor Skill gain - It should work properly with the new script. With this version, it's just checked if the player wears any light or heavy armor - one piece suffices to get a small skill advancement whenever you run or sprint in the worn armor.

- Unarmed Damage now scales with your Health at about +1.5 damage per 40 Health points

- Adjusted the effects of Fortify Lockpicking Enchantments:

�They now come in three different ranks:
�Rank I (common) also allows to pick Novice Locks without any training
�Rank II (rare) also allows to pick Novice and Apprentice Locks without any training
�Rank III (very rare) also allows to pick Novice, Apprentice and Adept Locks without any training


- Adjusted the effects of some shouts

- Decreased the damage of bolts some more

- Increased the protection against physical projectiles from Heavy Armor (both for you and the enemy)

- Decreased overall NPC archer accuracy to the value of the optional file

- Decreased the horse charge effect area
- Decreased the number of valid targets of trampling
- Decreased the stamina of all horses significantly
- The player gets blamed for horse charging into commoners, guards and such
- Increased the damage trample causes greatly
- Increased the prices of horses to 2500 coins

- Tweaks that should improve performance

- Tweaks that also make certain channeled custom spells non-continous
- Tweaks that alter the skill gain rate from a few selected spells to avoid exploits and to better balance their usability for leveling
- Tweaks that alter the magicka cost of most fire/lightning/frost spells to more equal values
- Tweaks that make projectile based destruction spell's cast time be more than halved

- Tweaks to the Attribute system:

�All attributes will now grant bonuses in steps of 40 (should fix some bugs and improves performance)

- Tweaks to the arrowweight script:

� It should now only fire when you actually pick up an arrow
� It should fix any remaining fluctuations

- Some more handplaced stuff in the Tutorial

- New Books to read

- Fixed some spelling mistakes
- Fixed the Firestorm Scroll bug

- The Perk Basic Lockpicking will give you a very slight chance to also open Apprentice Locks
- The Perk Advanced Lockpicking will give you a very slight chance to also open Adept Locks

- The Spell Teleport I and Teleport II are now considered Adept Level Spells


- Updated the Credits file

- Added some testing containers (spells, custom weapons) to the QASmoke interior (on Raikiens request)


- New optional files:

� Restored Saving Messages
� Weapon Damage modifier (2x, 3x the vanilla value)

- Updated optional files:

�LessBowDamage (now also governs Dawnguard Ammo); renamed it to Less Arrow and Bolt Damage
�Less Deadly Dragons (now governs Dawnguard Dragons, too)

- Removed Optional files

� Easier Lockpicking due to a major conflict with the main mod (will be reintegrated soon)



Changes in 0.96
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Disabled Bow Staggering as it seems to allow stunlocking even though the effect has conditions to prevent it from doing so on unappropriate opponents due to a bug in the CK, as it seems - the feature will be reintegrated when there is a fix/workaround

- Adjusted some more minor things not yet covered in terms of Dawnguard support:

�More Tweaks to the Gargoyles
�More Tweaks to all the Vampires

- Decreased the loot from some enemies (Boss warlock chests have only a chance of 33% to contain very high level loot)

- Tweaks to how some animals react to each other

Examples:

� Trolls will attack almost all of Skyrim's Fauna on sight
� Sabrecats and Wolfs will attack each other when coming too close
+ More

- More Tweaks to the Yielding System:

- No increased pickpocketing chances
- Many NPCs will now flee when there health drops below a certain threshold
-These races/factions/whatever have an extraordinary morality and are especially hard to get feared:

�Orcs
�Nord

�Forsworn
�Thalmor
�Hagraven Followers
�Daedra
�Vigilants of Stendarr
�Dawnguard Members
�The Afflicted

�Guards
�NPCs flagged as unique
�Vampires

- Certain conditions will break the fear effect (the player being paralysed, close to death)
- Animals might also flee when their Health drops to critical values. Some, however, are not affected by this:

�Trolls
�Ghostly Animals
�Large and Giant Spiders
�Mudcrabs

- NPCs will keep feared until they respawn (240 ingame hours by default)
- NPCs will not grant any gear - if you do want more than the treasure they have been most likely guarding, you have to take it that from their cold dead hands.
- Optional file that disables the improved yield system totally - for those who dislike it or want to use another mod that conflicts with these tweaks

- Increased the damage of silver weapons against creatures vulnerable to it slightly
- Decreased the damage of Bolts slightly


Changes in 0.95
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Built in support for Dawnguard - Unfortunately, this will cause the mod to crash the game when loaded without the Dawnguard .esm!!! If you do not own Dawnguard, I'd suggest using the version 0.94!

- Heal Self (I, II) is now only sold inside of Winterhold College - outside, it can only be found randomly
- Firesparks, Lightning Sparks, Icewind and all Wall spells now are fired for a fixed amount of time and then have to be recast instead of being continous (this is to prevent stacking their effects by just recasting them rapidly)
- More Tweaks to Bow Staggering
- Removed the passive armor skill increase in order to prevent further bugs 



Changes in 0.94:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Your respective armor skill does now increase passively as long as you wear a cuirass of the respective armor type, though the skill gain is minimal!
- Fleshed out the shrines of the divines some more: They will now only grant their blessing if you have NEVER commited any crime! This is even true for crimes that were not witnessed by anyone - the Gods do see everything - or at least more than mortals! Shrines will also dispel all temporary magic and remove all poisons from you!
- Decreased the amount of consumed stamina when running to one half of the current value
- Changed the description of some lockpicking perks some more to make it more clear that you need them in order to pick locks.
- Vendors now only respawn once a week - In times of such peril, trading is probably not as good as you could possibly restock every two days in general
- Removed Quick/Auto - save/load messages
- Sleeping in Armor will not grant you any Rested bonuses; in fact, it will remove all remaining ones, too!
- Made glass/ebony/dragon/daedric weapons and armor more expensive
- Adjusted the time of some effects (related to food)
- Added numbers to the effects of food by default
- Adjusted the skill rate for speechcraft
- Decreased the shout cooldown effect of Talos Blessing by half

- Tweaks to shouting bonuses:

�Decreased the bonus from your level from 5%/5 levels to 2%/5 levels with a 20% cap at 50.
�Added another cooldown bonus for your known words of Power:
For every six words you know, you get another 5% cooldown bonus, which caps at 50% for 60 or more known words.
�Added yet another cooldown bonus for the amount of times the player shouted:
For every hundred times the player shouted, there is a slight bonus of 1% cooldownbonus, which caps at 10% with 1000 shouts or more.
�Also, based on how often you've shouted certain shouts' effects become even more powerful. You'll have gained the maximum effect bonus possible like this for all affected shouts after you have shouted 500 times.
An example:
- Firebreath: For every 50 times you shouted, a damage over time effect will be added to the original shout, totalling at 5x the effect (The effect itself sets your target ablaze for 30 seconds, dealing extra damage - the more effects are taking place, the more intense the fire effect will be). The damage depends on the number of words having been shouted and the amount of total shout uses (capping at 250).
Shouts affected by this for now:
- Firebreath
- Frostbreath
- Marked for Death
- Ice Form

- Implemented True Yield:

With the permission of its author, I have just "copy-pasted" all its components and added all necessary stuff to the player, though I did not run many tests with it - if it doesn't work properly, please inform me about it!

I made some tweaks though:

- You can now also pickpocket worn items and weapons from yielding targets as long as combat is already over, but not when there still are enemies engaged
- Yielding people will now flee from you for a long while

- Fixed some spelling mistakes

- Added Script Source Files to the main archive so people who wish to make sub-mods can have a look at them!
- Updated the Credits file and added a section for donators

New optional files:

- Shrines give blessings only to those who do not currently have a bounty


Changes in 0.93:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Added Lockbreaking to certain weaker doors and containers:

When you melee attack such a door or container (basically all which are made mainly out of wood), a script attached to it will check the player's adjusted breaking value (which is 2x your health + 1x your stamina) - if it's at least equal to the break value of the lock, the container will be open after you hit it.

Breaking values are as follows:

Novice: 300
Apprentice: 500
Adept: 700

Expert and Master level locks cannot be broken, however, regardless of the material!

- Added Dispel Potions:

� Renamed Elixir of Cure Disease to Elixir of Vitality - besides curing any disease, it will also cure every poison and remove ALL ongoing magic effects. Also increased the price of this potion greatly.
� Alchemic Ingredients that have the Cure Disease Effect now also function like this accordingly!

- Added some more handplaced items (Milk, Water)

- Tweaked movement: Normal running (not sprinting) also consumes a very small amount of stamina each second (0.4 points/second)
- Tweaks to bow staggering, as it still does not work a 100% correctly
- Tweaks to certain quest rewards (Small quest rewards were set to 400 coins - now, it's 25 coins! If there seem to be unrealistic reward levels, please inform me! It's hard to tell if this is set correctly in the Editor!
- Tweaks to warlocks: Non-Boss warlocks now possess less health
- Tweaks to how spells that knock people down work:

�The Shout Unrelenting Force does not work on targets with a high enough magic resistance anymore - depending on how many words are used, the necessary resistances increases (25%/35%/50%). This is true for both NPCs and the player.

- More Tweaks to Farkas and Aela the Huntress , as they tend to switch equipment rather often

- Fixed a bug related to horses also knocking down the player when riding fast

- Splitted the ReadMe and the changelog into two different text files


Changes in 0.92:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Horse charge: Weak and small enemies are trampled down when a horse charges into them
- Changed the Health/Weight effects so that it gives you +4 carry weight every 40 points of health - maybe this will fix the bugs some people encounter with it!

- The Thalmor Archers in Northwatch Keep now actually use Elven stuff
- Changed the Skillrates some more (this will cause skill books to not level up a skill by one, but only by one third!)
- Adjusted the Skillgain from some spells
- Decreased the duration of Lightning Jolt by about 50% - it now only works on target with magic resistance below 41.
- Decreased the effect of chaurus poisons
- Disabled AutoAim for good
- More intelligent behaviour of NPCs when it comes to pick up weapons
- Experimental Tweaks to sneaking:

� Sneaking in general is harder
� Enemies field of view has been reduced
� Enemies will search much longer for you
� Standing in Light has now a greater risk for being detected
� The impact of your sneak skill has been reduced slightly

- Replaced many muffle enchantments with sneak skill bonuses as muffle seems to be glitchy
- Alchemists with at least 25 skill points can now craft special oils at the forge that work like poisons:

- Oil of Fire: Deals fire damage
- Oil of Frost: Deals frost damage
- Oil of Storms: Deals shock damage
- Oil of Silver: Deals severe damage to any enemy vulnerable to silver


Each oil needs a certain tye of salt, a metal ingot base and some dwarven oil to be crafted

Unfortunately, they only work on living enemies, as the game seems not to check the associated resistance value but the poison flag of the potion in order to judge if an effect can harm an undead or otherwise poison immune NPC.

- The Perk Necromancy now prevents your raised servants to crumble to dust when they die or the spell wears off!
- The Perk Well Fitted (Light Armor) has been replaced with "Combat Reflexes", which grants you a "Use at Will" power that slows time by 50 percent but also drains 100 stamina over 10 seconds - it won't work if you have less or when you wear any heavy armor!
- Player Homes are now automatically locked when you leave it
- Giant camps are much harder to loot - all giant chests now have master difficulty locks, but the loot they yield has been greatly decreased - the giants themselves now carry most of the precious stuff
- More handplaced stuff
- Tweaked the Axe of Whiterun greatly

- Fixed some spelling mistakes
- Fixed some minor bugs (too minor to list it all :P)

�Somethign needs testing: I've encountered some crashes while working on the update, though I am not sure if they're due to vanilla bugs or because of Requiem - When I release the next update, it would be great to know if anyone experiences increased crashrates, so I know if I screwed something up!


Changes in 0.91:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- New ability: Charge into an enemy and make him fall down - only works on humanoid sized or smaller things and only if the opponent is eiter not heavily armored or has only low HP/STA while you need to be over 200 HP and STA each
- Added a really helpful type of new item - the "Bag of Holding", which increases your max carry weigth by 500 when it is in your inventory. For now, six of them can be found - there are easily overlooked, however, so look carefully!

- Some more tweaks on Irileth
- Some more handplaced stuff
- A single set of Daedric Armor has been scattered in the gameworld
- A second Atronach Forge can be found in the game world - it's cosmetic at the moment however. Still, you'll want to find it - A lot of treasure awaits!
- Tempering items now also requires the respective smithing perk
- Adjusted the weight and prices of many items
- Adjusted tempering values
- Adjusted the cost of bashing

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Changing the version number greatly as the mod gets closer and closer to 1.0

�Heavy Arrows (Ebony, Daedric) weigh 0.3 units each

- Some more spells:

�Summon Ghostly Archer
�Summon Ghostly Warrior
�Summon Ghostly Wraith
�Summon Ghostly Lich

�Blackout (similiar to Silence, but slightly different)

- Craftable Staffs at the forge:

� Depending on your enchantment skill, you'll find new recipes for magical staffs of different materials. The better the material, the better the spell it can hold - Artificing a Daedric Staff will yield an arcane instrument of power that does not require any charges as it feeds on the life force of a slain dremora.

- More Tweaks to Loot Lists

- The Conjuration skill will increase your summoning limit by one for every 33 points, capping at 3.
- Potions that restore magicka, health or stamina will not do that instantly, but over a time of 10 seconds. However, the overall effect has been increased. This also affects all ingredients with these effects. However, the best potions (Surpassing ones) will still restore you completly instantly.
- Dremora Hearts are now very useful alchemic ingredients. If used with a fitting ingredient, the resulting potion will restore health, stamina or magicka completly every second for 30 seconds - or if used to make a poison, a truly deadly toxin the result. You'll now have to think about what to do with them even more properly.
- Nirnroots are now more useful alchemic ingredients, as their effects have a stronger magnitude than common stuff.
- Daedric Artifacts now function without consuming any charges, making them usable without the neccessity to reload them with soulgems.
- The Spellbreaker has received a slight boost in strength.
- Konahrik's Mask has been tweaked somewhat to make it less annoying.
- Decreased the penalty for sneaking in light by half to prevent pitch black light still causing you to be a light christmas tree.
- Increased the stamina cost of blocking

- Renamed some Destruction spells and their books accordingly
- Skooma now has drastically altered effects:

It'll boost melee damage by 50% for 120 seconds, while leading to a degeneration of stamina and magicka for 5 minutes that also cancels all forms of general regeneration. It'll also increase your total stamina by 2000 points for 120 seconds, but then, the effect wears off and you'll be every exhausted. Side effects from prolongued use might also occur. ranging from short spontaneous paralyzation to instant death...
- Altered the effects of alcoholic drinks

� Fast Travel Reenabled which does what is says
� Fast Travel Reenabled disabled which disables the Fast Travel Reenabled if you want to change back

Those who have chosen the Mage will never be able to have another sign but The Mage, The Apprentice, The Atronach or The Ritual.
Those who have chosen the Warrior will never be able to have another sign but The Warrior, The Lady, The Lord or The Steed.
Those who have chosen the Thief will never be able to have another sign but The Thief, The Shadow, The Lover or The Tower.
If you don't choose a guardian constellation, you can do it later - Or, you can choose the Snake, which renders all other signs inobtainable! Your choice is permanent, so choose wisely!

- Fixed the bow staggering mechanism - it should work now as intended, though these changes might need a new start to take effect because of the way the associated perks work

- The Perk Dragon Armor will allow now only allow you to craft Dragon Scale/Dragonplate Armor, if you possess the Perk Glass Smithing/Daedric Smithing
- The Perk Fletching is now called "Gruesome Shot" and will increase all damage dealt in a very close range when using a bow. The arrows are now part of the smithing perks.
- The Weapon Specialization Bonuses for Twohanded Weapons now grant higher bonuses than those of their onehanded counterparts do.
- Sneak Attacking with a bow now will only grants a bonus if you're close to the target, though if you reach certain thresholds in the Archery skill, the range that grants bonus damage will increase - upon reaching level 100, you'll be able to score a sneak attack over any distance with ranged weapons.
- Summon Ghostly Steed is now considered an Adept Level Conjuration spell
- When the player's stamina is below 34 points, all spell costs will double

- Reduced available training units per level to 3 (and included optional files for this value)
- Doubled the amount of arrows you get from the Bound Bow Spell
- Added the Imperial Bow to the lsit opf craftable items
- Handplaced some new monsters in a special location

- Fleshed out the player's attributes some more in order to make it even more oldschool style, with a modern touch ,though.

�Magicka will have the following side effects, as it now represents Intelligence and Willpower:

Every 10 points increase Magic Resistance by 0.25%. Caps at 25%.
Every 10 points increase Magicka Regen by 2%. Caps at 200%.

�Stamina will have the following side effects, as it now stands for endurance and agility:

Every 10 points increase damage with bows by .35%. Caps at 35%.
Every 10 points increase stamina regen by 2%. Caps at 200%.
Every 40 points increase poison resistance by 1%. Caps at 25%.
Every 40 points increase disease resistance by 1%. Caps at 25%.


�Health will have the following side effects, as it now represents strength and vitality:

Every 10 points increase carry weight by 1 point. Caps at 100.
Every 10 points increase damage with melee weapons (except daggers because of a vanilla bug) by 0.35%. Caps at 35%.
Every 40 points increase poison resistance by 1%. Caps at 25%.
Every 40 points increase disease resistance by 1%. Caps at 25%.

Please consider that these values are determined by your current value and not the maximum. Say you've got 500 Health as your maximum but Werewolf strikes you down to 250, then you'll only get the bonuses for having a health of 250!!!
Also, this won't only calculate for attribute points you bought, but also those you gain via enchantments, spells etc. - this should make stuff like Fortify Stamina and similar ones even more worth your while...
The Bonuses you receive by these attributes will not be shown in the Active Effects, however!
This is because of both immersive and performances reasons, as showing them would cause severe stability issues. You can still see how they affect the associated stuff, like encumbrance etc.


Changes in 0.17:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The required books will have a description text that will make clear that the book is used for advancing in the smithing tree and can be obtained by finding them in the world or by buying them, though not every blacksmith or scholar might want to share his knowledge.
Generally, books that are related more to craftmanship will be purchasable by blacksmiths (Orcish, Scale, Plate, Glass, Ebony etc.) while those related more to research and magic (Dwarven, Elven) will be acquirable from some scholars/mages. Dragon and Daedric books will only be able to be found in the world and it will take a long time looking for them, as only one to two examples exist in all of Skyrim...

Changes in 0.14:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- More tweaks to main quest and guild related characters
- More tweaks to enemy spells
- Draugrs have a much smaller chance of wieding more than just Draugr Weapons.
- Draugrs will be more suspectible to bladed weapons while having even more resistance to arrows and bludgeoning damage. Slightly decreased shock resistance because they're magical beings and lightning is meant to destroy magic which I didn't consider beforehand. Also, they'll receive some more extra health.
- Vampires will now also be dealt much more damage by bladed weapons, though bludgeoning them will have an even lesser effect
- Frost Atronachs now can be fought quite effectively by fighters experienced in the use of warhammers and maces.
- Tweaked Skeletons some more
- Giants will now be more resistant to arrows
- Mammoths will now be more resistant to arrows
- Changed the spawn ratio of many creatures: Draugrs, Spiders, Animals
- Wards will dampen the impact of all physical attacks, decreasing incoming wounds significantly (Also applies to many opponents!) The downside is that they now cost slightly more - one reason for defensive mages to actually invest perks into restoration
- Mage Armor Magnitude will also increase with the Alteration Skill Level
- Some illusion spells now scale correctly with increasing skill level
- Slightly decreased bashing cost
- Decreased Stamina Consumption on Blocking attacks
- Altered Race description texts some more
- Some more alterations in Helgen Keep
- More tweaks to playable races (Carry weight, Health, Stamina, Magicka, skills, unarmed damage - also applies to all other characters besides the player, though the effect is minimal)

- More Tweaks to Basic Needs:

I decided to built in a light basic needs overhaul that isn't comparable to the more complex mods - but still I felt like doing something by default about the matter:

- Food now restores both higher amounts of stamina and magicka, but only when consumed out of combat.
- Cooked food will restore even more and ongoing effects now last serveral hours
- Raw meat will damage stamina and magicka on consumption, but beast races (Orks, Khajiit and Argonians) will receive the same amount as a bonus instead.

- The default skill increase rates are now very low and are greatly boosted by sleeping. It's optional but it'll make leveling up MUCH easier.

- Heartbeating will now occur at 50/25%
- Dragon Fear Aura shouldn't affect important quest related characters
- Dragons should be a little more managable, especially the first encounter outside of Whiterun
- Dragons will deal highly decreased melee damage if the player wears at least 4 pieces of Ebony, Daedric, Dragonplate or Dragonscale Armor.
- Irileth now possesses a magical armor that grants protection from fire and frost
- Tweaked light armor perks some more
- Replaced the effect of Agility with an overall attack speed gain
- Doubled the damage bonus of weapon mastery basic perks
- Increased Falling Damage
- Fixed the non-working scripts

- Experimental tweaks to bows:

� Targets that wear heavy armor now will be dealt less damage with bows when not having perks in Point Blank Shot
� Wearing at least 4 pieces of heavy armor will always decrease damage inflicted by incoming arrows by a fixed percentage.

- Greatly decreased probability to find high quality items
- Increased the loot of all merchant strongboxed to a more fitting level, also making it more appealing to play as a thief



Changes in 0.13:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Some unique, not-respawning Encounters have been placed in the world.

One example:

�Gorak, the Trollslayer: A giant who leads a small clan at the Guldun Rock Cave - he collects the corpses of trolls he kills as trophies. And he also is known for collecting money and other tokens from adventurers that get in his way...

- Be ready to be sometimes swallowed whole by giant slaughterfish if you dare to venture too far into deep waters...
- Slightly altered lootlists from some animals
- Enemy mages now aim much more precisely
- Tweaked all Guards some more
- Dragons will strike fear into the hearts of those who aren't truly brave or foolhardy
- Changed Conjure Dremora Lord: the Dremora Lord is now an EVIL being that'll mob the floor with most things that dare to cross his path, but now, it's a master spell!
- Made all "rune-decorated" trigger plates in nordic ruins invisible - triggering mechanism would probably be hidden so well by the architects that they couldn't be noticed by practically anyone. You'll hate that moment when you hear the click and know something REALLY bad is bound to happen...
- New Spells:

�Conjure Dremora Archer (Master)
�Conjure Dremora Mage (Master)
�Summon Ghostly Troll (Adept)
�Summon Ghostly Sabrecat (Expert)
�Summon Ghostly Werewolf (Master)
�Summon Ghostly Mudcrab (Apprentice)

- Changes to existing spells:

�Cloak spells will now also increase resistance to one element:

Firecloak will melt most of incoming ice projectiles and such -> more frost resistance
Frostcloak will freeze all incoming flames and fire projectiles -> more flame resistance
Lightning Cloak will electromagnetically reroot most lightning attacks -> more shock resistance

The resistance will increase with your destruction level, but you still can have only one cloak at a time. Also, these changes affect enemies as well! So watch out!

- Changed Perks:

� Disintegration replaced with Arcane Disruption: Lightning spells now have a chance to burn even more magicka and to dispel all ongoing magical effects on a target. Very deadly to all summoned creatures, but it won't work on anything with an exceptional shock resistance!

- New Enchantments:

�Spellbreaking: Chance to dispel all temporary effects when striking a target (especially deadly to summoned creatures)

- More lootlist changes, decreased probability of finding high quality armor and weapons
- Some more handplaced stuff
- Some minor text corrections
- Some minor changes warlocks, dragons, banidts and undead stuff
- Major changes to Draugrs: They'll now be more sucpectible to melee weapons, while they're almost immune to arrows. Also adjusted some entries I did oversee when editing them.
- Increased the mastery level of all ward spells

- Changed the mechanism of most enemy poisons because of a weird bug of the vanilla cure poison/resist poison effect:

Now, whenever something tries to poison you, it'll check your poison resistance. If it's above a certain value (depending on the creature's strength), you won't be affected for your body will fight it off. If it's below, you've got a serious problem, so remember to boost your poison resistance before facing those monsters! If not, you'll most likely regret it!
