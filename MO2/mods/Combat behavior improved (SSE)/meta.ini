nexusDescription="===========================================================================================\r<br />NOTICE:\r<br />The hkx files from the old mod have been converted to their respective 64bit versions by:\xa0[url=https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/9414960-thetechpony/]TheTechPony [/url], thanks to him you can now try this out in SSE.\r<br />===========================================================================================\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />For the diehard gamers that just cant let skyrim go (apparently Skyrim can&#39;t let the diehard gamers go, with Bethesda releasing a special edition in 2016 and all ;p):\r<br />\r<br />This mod alters skyrim&#39;s behavior files to make your combat experience in skyrim \r<br />more dynamic and more challenging. Editing behavior files is complicated\r<br /> but not impossible thanks to the work of modders such as [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4959835/?]Zartar[/url]. Zartar kindly enough provided vital info on behavior files and invented\r<br /> behavior code that allows both players and NPC&#39;s to cancel their \r<br />melee attacks by blocking, adding a whole new dimension to melee combat \r<br />without the use of scrips or even an esp file. Zartar also explained how\r<br /> to speed up movement during 2handed swings.\r<br /> See the video&#39;s below for an example of this mod:\r<br />\r<br />(warning: video&#39;s contain vanilla skyrim gore)\r<br />\r<br />[youtube]MVxNdICIfqE[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]fmb6mLsO7_M[/youtube]\r<br />[youtube]uRsczcrDk7A[/youtube]\r<br />\r<br />* Note that some mods visible in the video (such as cloaks, animation \r<br />replacers and sounds) are made by other users and are obviously not \r<br />included in this mod. Look for them on the nexus.\r<br />\r<br />[b]INSTALLATION:\r<br />No scripts, no esp files, all you have to do is extract the files from the archive into Skyrim Special Edition&#39;s ...data/meshes/actors/behavior[/b]s folder. There are 3 behavior files, \r<br />1hm_behavior.hkx/blockbehavior.hkx/bashbehavior.hkx each adding \r<br />sepparate features. \r<br />To UNINSTAL: remove said from said directory.\r<br />Note that if you want to install optional files (see below), you have to \r<br />install the optional files AFTER you install the main files.\r<br />\r<br />optional files:\r<br />An optional file (&#39;no-block window&#39;) is added which will not allow you to \r<br />cancel attacks and block\xa0\x66or a few miliseconds after you struck your \r<br />enemy\xa0 (for more immersion, difficulty etc.).\r<br />Another optional file adds 2 extra blockHit animations (made by [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62928/?]5oiler[/url]) when you block incoming hits while dualwielding. \r<br />\r<br />REQUIREMENTS/COMPATIBILITY\r<br />This mod works best with the lastest version of skyrim installed. This mod \r<br />will conflict with other mods that alter 1hm_behavior.hkx \r<br />blockbehavior.hkx & bashbehavior.hkx.\r<br />\r<br />RECOMMENDED MODS:\r<br />Its recommended to use this mod with other mods that improve NPC combat AI such as[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56147/?] combat evolved[/url]. Its also recommended to use animation replacers: [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/44014]Pseudo parry by topeira and Krish698[/url] and [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62928/?]dual wield improved animation by 5poiler[/url].\r<br />\r<br />The following features are included in this mod (listed per file).\r<br />[i]1hm_behavior.hkx:[/i]\r<br />- Vampire/Spellsword attack intro fixed (no attack intro when casting+attacking in vanilla skyrim)\r<br />- 2handed attacking + walking at the same speed as 1h attacking + walking\r<br />- Pressing your block key during an attack will automatically cancel any \r<br />attack sequence and put you into block stance (NPCs will automatically \r<br />also use this feature&#33;)\r<br />- Hitframe increased for 1h attacks, making timed blocking possible.\r<br />- Dualwield: left hand normal swing is tweaked to match swings per second (and hitframe) to righthanded swings.\r<br />- Dual Daggers: Fixed power attack speed glitch\r<br />\r<br />[i]blockbehavior.hkx:\r<br />- The playback speed of blockhit animations is increased drastically so you can hit the attacker back almost instantly.\r<br />SIDE NOTE FOR MODDERS: if you want to replace the dualwield blockhit animation, replace bow_blockhit.hkx ;)\r<br />\r<br />bashbehavior[/i]\r<br />- Bashing hitframe and bashing animation increased to allow timed blocking against incoming bashes against 1h/2h/shield bash.\r<br />- Dualwield bash is no longer deals damage but has the same stagger effect as other bash attacks.\r<br />- Bow bash no longer deals damage but has the same stagger effect as other bash attacks.\r<br />\r<br />Currently many of the features from this mod only work in third person.\r<br />\r<br />CREDITS\r<br />Zartar: &#39;Blocking cancels attacking&#39; feature and providing critical info on behavior files.
