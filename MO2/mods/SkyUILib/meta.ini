nexusDescription="[b][u]Overview[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />I wanted to make a preset for the character Stiga from the show Castlevania, I would've made it without CotR but the face morphs are way better for making customized characters.\n<br />\n<br />It's not completely accurate but that wasn't my intention, I felt like it needed a softer touch to it while still holding the same imagery, since Striga's Features are so sharp, and don't really fit into Skyrim's graphics very well. I originally made this for personal use but felt like others might like it as well. If you ever manage to find a good looking armour that suits her feel free to message me - Volkihar Knight Armor\xa0was the best I could find as of now."
