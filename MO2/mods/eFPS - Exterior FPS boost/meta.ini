New versions will be for some extensions or bugfix, but at the moment the project is very stable. Our goal is to make this mod a must-have thanks to the advantages that it brings in term of optimization and performance. eFPS - Exterior FPS boost only touches exteriors - interiors are already covered by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14084]Skyrim Project Optimization SE[/url].\n<br />\n<br />eFPS - Exterior FPS boost makes extensive use of a native engine feature called [font=Arial][size=3][url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_surface_determination]Occlusion Culling[/url][/size][/font]. Occlusion Panes have been strategically hand-placed to enhance performance without affecting visibility and immersion. These panes are placed inside walls, houses, mountains and any big object in general, drastically reducing the draw calls. In our testing we've detected improvements of up to 5-20 FPS in certain critical areas. Occlusion Culling is hardly ever implemented in Skyrim by both Devs and Mod Authors because it is both a delicate and tedious process. eFPS - Exterior FPS boost is the first mod of its kind!\n<br />\n<br />Anyway we put thousands occlusion panes and boxes in big part of the map [font=Arial][size=3]one by one[/size][/font]. These panes are placed inside walls, houses, big objects, mountains and so on, it reduces the draw calls drastically (that means [b]a[/b] [b]5 to 20 FPS[/b] [b]gain[/b] in certain critical areas).\n<br />Certainly the increase in performance is inversely proportional to the power of your computer. If you have a very very very powerful PC, you may only see a small improvement in FPS. On the other hand, the idea of this mod is to improve performance especially for those who do not have an ultra-powerful PC. \n<br />\n<br />[center]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=6]With version 2.2 we can gladly announce that we have covered approximately 95% of the entire Skyrim region.

With only one mandatory request: our mod must ALWAYS be needed as a base.We will obviously not give support for patches made by others, we will supervise them.On our discord channel we will always keep a list of the patches we are doing, so please adjust accordingly. [/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Let's move on to the (slightly) bad news!\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][/size][/font][list]\n<br />[*][font=Arial][size=3][b]EXISTING SAVES[/b][/size][/font]\n<br />[/list][font=Arial][size=3]\n<br />Long story short, we recommend to start a new game when installing this mod. We still haven't completely figured out how [font=Arial][size=3]eFPS[/size][/font] behaves with existing saves. One of our tester reported FPS drops on their very old heavily-modded savefile while getting the expected FPS boost on new games. Other testers with more recent savefiles reported no issues with [font=Arial][size=3]eFPS[/size][/font], and could benefit from the FPS boost without having to start from scratch. Still, we feel it's safer to start a new game and that's our official recommendation.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/font][list]\n<br />[*][font=Arial][size=3][b]INCOMPATIBLE MOD[/b][/size][/font]\n<br />[/list][font=Arial][size=3]As of now, mods that move or delete existing architecture are incompatible with [font=Arial][size=3]eFPS[/size][/font]. We are currently working on patches for the most popular mods, but it's a time-consuming process. we are creating a specific Patch Hub. In the meantime, you can join our Discord to get early access to alpha version patches!\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][size=4][b]Version for Anniversary Edition [color=#ffffff]--&gt;[/color] [/b][/size][/color][color=rgb(97, 97, 97)][size=4][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58727][b]link[/b][/url][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][size=5][b][color=#00ff00]Official Patch HUB[/color] [size=3][size=5][b]--&gt;[/b][/size][/size][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54998] link[/url][/b][/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][color=#00ff00]Other early patches at our server[/color] --&gt;[/b]\xa0 [url=https://discord.gg/2E5cqnGYph ]DISCORD[/url][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][center][font=Arial][size=3][img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/50133/50133-1629445917-1935787738.png[/img][/size][/font][/center][font=Arial][size=3]\n<br />This NEED TO BE ESM or when we will make patches you'll have problems, and this mod is intendend for new game as written on compatibility section.
