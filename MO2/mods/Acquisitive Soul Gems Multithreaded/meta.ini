Even $1 helps.[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />(Please note: Internationalization will [i]not[/i] work without SKSE64, because SKSE64 actually handles the translating.)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />This mod is based on the now \"obsolete\" and unsupported mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5312/?][b]ACQUISITIVE SOUL GEMS[/b][/url]. In fact, it's almost the same mod. Just like with that one, this mod makes it so you never trap anything less than the maximum size soul a Soul Gem can handle.\n<br />\n<br />\"Almost the same mod?\xa0What's the difference?\", you say?\n<br />---\n<br />First off, ASGM (this mod) definitely works in the Special Edition, which is why you're here.\n<br />\n<br />ASG [i]probably[/i] does as well, but since the author of ASG isn't supporting it any longer, you'll never see it in the SSE mod list. ASG also requires USLEEP, which may not work on SSE, and the SSE patch by the same author- USSEP- may not fill ASG's USLEEP requirement. Yes, it's possible to fix all those problems, but bluedanieru, the author, isn't going to do it, and this mod exists, so why would you bother?\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />ASGM has localization, which means that the mod is in your language, not just English.\n<br />Supported languages are Czech, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, and Spanish.\n<br />\n<br />If SKSE64 is installed, which is required by SkyUI, Internationalization will be enabled automagically when the ASGM MCM menu is opened.\n<br />\n<br />(Thanks go to dodo007777, Ulrik, archerarcher, Oktober, lolikyonyu, Keresh, adelinadragonborn, and Jokerine for their work on the translations.)\n<br />(Thanks also go to irasik, Zwizzor, Ranua, and DemiMaxzu for the translations for the new feature added in v4.6)\n<br />\n<br />If SKSE64 is not installed, all messages will only be in English.\n<br />---\n<br />Here's a video showing the difference between how Soul Trapping looks in Vanilla, old versions of ASG, and, finally, ASGM and ASG 3.0:\n<br />[youtube]xecna0f_iqs[/youtube]\n<br />Personally, I think the mod's staggering trap effect is much cooler than vanilla's all-at-once thing.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />Brand new with v4.6.6 is the ability to tell ASGM about any non-Vanilla soul gem items that were added by a mod by simply placing a json file in a certain folder. This is more for modders than for users, but literally anyone can make the needed file, so if the author of your mod hasn't made an ASGM json file for the soul gems added by that mod, feel free to do it yourself, and pm the file to the author so (s)he can include it in the mod!\n<br />\n<br />Details are in the readme file.\n<br />---\n<br />Finally, and most importantly, IMO, ASGM has options. With ASG, Black Soul Gems can only harvest Black Souls, and that's also true of the Black Star, and Azura's Star isn't restricted to only being \"full\" like the regular gems are- it can hold any size soul except Black. With this mod, that's all configurable.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Do you want[/b] to be able to trap not-Black souls in Black Soul Gems and the Black Star?\n<br />[b]Do you want [/b]to not waste Azura's Star on a Petty Soul?\n<br />[b]Do you want [/b]those messages about if a soul got captured or not to stop showing up?\n<br />[b]Do you want [/b]to be able to capture souls when you don't have a big enough Soul Gem, even if that means capturing it as a smaller soul?\n<br />\n<br />Well, I have good news for you, all of those things are configurable in this mod! Even better, while I do provide an MCM menu for you to change the options, you poor laddies and gentlelasses that don't have SkyUI can still change the settings with the included ASGM Settings Book! Yay!\n<br />\n<br />That's it! That's all the wondrous goodness of this mod!\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Conclusion:\n<br />[/size]Use it or don't as you wish.\n<br />\n<br />If you like it, thank you. I don't personally care if this gets endorsed, but endorsing does make it more likely that other people who may like it will see it, so, do it for them. :)\n<br />\n<br />This isn't the only ancient mod I've made an update for!
